But I'm ready for it. I mean, I have a lot of energy left, mentally, physically good. So I'm just going to give it all, and we'll see where it ends.</div>

This is an incredible opportunity for me to play at such a high level, and I'm just excited to see how things unfold in the semifinals.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, for sure. As I started to win points and games, I felt more confident, and that definitely helped me to move better and play more freely. It’s a big part of my game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Absolutely, I completely agree with that. When you gain confidence and start winning, it really propels you forward. It's like a cycle where the more you win, the better you feel, and the harder you work, which leads to even more success. Confidence and momentum are incredibly powerful in sports, especially in tennis.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was a little bit of everything. I was trying to mix my game. Obviously, I have a big weapon in my forehand, so I wanted to use it more. And at the same time, try to move a lot, play the ball deep. So I feel like everything was working pretty good today.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I missed a couple of slams for injuries and then last year obviously here I was far and in the US Open I was close because I was in the run of 16 and having 4-3-3 left in the third, in the fifth, so I was close to make that happen, but I didn't and here happened. So happy for that, playing and completing very well during the whole event, so that's very important for me.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was definitely a tough match, especially with the change in styles. The third set was incredibly dramatic, and it really tested my mental and physical endurance. I knew I had to dig deep, but at the same time, I had to adjust my game to keep up. It was a challenge, but I’m proud of how I handled the pressure.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern. During that match, I was focused on the game and didn't feel the impact of the ankle at that moment. However, after the match I noticed some discomfort. I'll definitely be taking steps to ensure it doesn't affect my performance in future matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel like my performance has been consistent across both the practice court and the match court.

The practice sessions have allowed me the opportunity to fine-tune my shots, while the matches have given me valuable experience in applying those skills under pressure. Overall, I'm pleased with my progress and am looking forward to continuing to improve.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that the provided file is an image rather than a video, so I can't analyze any facial expressions or body language from a video context. However, if you provide more details about the athlete’s expression or give a description of their body language in the image, I can give you an informed prediction about their response to the reporter’s question.
