        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it's tough. I mean, I've played 10 matches, I think, here. Crazy. Every single day, I haven't had a day off. I don't know the last time I had a day off. I played every day, and yeah, yesterday, for sure. Also, emotionally, it was quite draining, and it was really incredible. And physically, I mean, every day I played, and it was difficult to heal the leg. It was difficult to do everything, but I don't want to make it about that. No excuse at all. It was tough, for sure. It would have been nice to have a day off, but I didn't. I tried my best today. I feel like I have nothing to be ashamed of. Bring on it.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, I was hoping I could play at that level. So, no, I'm very happy that I was able to rise to a level that I needed to beat Richard and, you know, it was tough. The score shows it as well. I could have done it maybe a bit faster. At the same time, I'm happy to have done it the way it happens. So, now I was pleased. I think I did some good shots, told different conditions today. You know, from 10% humidity, we went to 75%. So that was interesting. And I think we were both feeling it. You know, all of a sudden you were sweating like mad. So it was different. But I was happy the way I played. And I also thought, Richard, we both played a good level again. So it was fun.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was 4-2 up in the second set and I had a few break points and then the game was a little tight and she played a good point and the next game I missed the forehand by a couple of millimeters and after that I think she felt more confident and that's why she started to play more aggressive and it was tough to handle that and in this particular game but it's a part of tennis and sometimes it happens that the other player is better on that day so you have to accept it and you just have another chance the day after

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think that Rafa's play is very comfortable, plays very good. Maybe at the beginning of the match I was not very good with myself. It was why Rafa starts with a lot of confidence and starts to play much better. But when Rafa plays like this, it's very tough to do something. I think that I tried to push, I tried to be aggressive, but Rafa was all the time there. With his forehand down the line, he destroyed me. Well, I congratulate him and try to continue my way because when these guys, when Rafa plays like this, it's really complicated. That forehand down the line...</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think he played very well. I didn't play any of his returns. He was very solid on his serve. It was just a few points that I missed, but I was a little bit on the back foot. And I thought that he was going to be on my side a lot. But I felt that it was 50-50, which is the best thing that you can feel in the match. So I'm happy with that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Nadal's aggressive baseline play and powerful forehands made it challenging for me today. His ability to consistently hit winners and dictate the pace of the game put me on the defensive.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I have not had the opportunity to play with Jung Taek Lee, but I am familiar with his reputation as a talented player. It's always great to see talented athletes from Korea. As for him being a coach, I have no information on that. I hope to have the chance to meet and play alongside him someday.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, Jung Taek Lee is definitely one of the top players in Korea, and I've heard a lot about his accomplishments. I have played with him before, and he's someone I respect a lot for his skills and experience. As for being a coach, I haven't had that experience personally, but I do know of his influence in the tennis community.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I think I've definitely made improvements, but I also think that at the end of the day, tennis is tennis, and some of my most challenging matches were at 25Ks and 60Ks, playing Sasha Vickery in the finals of a 25K and having it be a three-set match. I've faced some of my toughest matches there, and so I think the biggest thing is now I'm playing in bigger tournaments every week, I'm playing a full WTA schedule, and now I'm just playing against bigger opponents that people are more familiar with.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the compliment. It's been a challenging journey, but I've worked hard to improve my game and reach this level. I'm proud of how far I've come and I'm excited to see where my career takes me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "Yeah, it's been a crazy year. I'm really proud of how far I've come, but I know there's still a lot of work to do. I'm just focusing on staying consistent and improving my game every day." 

Based on the athlete's expression and body language, it seems like they might respond with a humble acknowledgment of their progress while emphasizing the work ahead. The slight smile and the relaxed demeanor suggest confidence, but also a modest approach to discussing their improvement.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your kind words. It's definitely been a challenging journey, and I've worked very hard to improve my game. I'm grateful for the support and opportunities that have helped me reach this position. There's still a lot of work to be done, but I feel much more confident now than I did a year ago.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> There's a lot of changes that I've made. There was a couple of things that maybe I didn't, I was really focused on my physical side of my game, but now I feel like I'm playing a bit more of a complete match. I have a variety of shots that are really coming together. My serve has improved quite a few times. And yeah, there's just been a really good focus from my side.

Like I said, I've been able to hang around long enough in these matches to put myself in a position where we can go out there on Saturday and have a red-hot crack and try and make my first fourth round.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it means a lot to me. It's not just about winning another match, but about proving to myself and everyone else that I can keep pushing forward and achieve more. It's about showing that I'm capable of overcoming challenges and reaching new heights.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. Going one step further would mean advancing to the next round, which is a significant achievement. It would also signify a progression in my performance and a step closer to reaching my goals. I appreciate the opportunity to compete and will continue to give my best effort in each match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It would mean a lot to me to take that next step. I’ve been working really hard, and reaching beyond the third round would feel like a big achievement. It’s about building confidence and continuing to push myself to improve.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was a little bit more aggressive than the last time. I played her in the US Open, I remember. She beat me in straight sets, so I tried to play aggressive, but she beat one more time than me. So I'm not sure why, because she's a very good player, she knows how to find her ground strokes. But she was better than that time, and she didn't give me much chances.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I think we've definitely grown a lot since the US Open in 2016. The experience and lessons learned from that match have been instrumental in our development. Tonight, I feel we were more composed and executed our game plan more effectively. It's been a long time since that event, and I'm proud of how far we have come. However, we always strive to improve, so there's still a great deal to learn and work on. Thank you.

Each match is an opportunity to grow, and tonight I feel like I was able to execute my strategy more effectively. However, there's still a lot of work to do to reach the level I want to be at.
