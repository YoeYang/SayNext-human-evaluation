              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm sorry, but I can't provide a response based on the given format as it seems to be a request for a specific type of response that doesn't align with the video content. The athlete's facial expressions and body language suggest he is in pain or discomfort, which might indicate he is unable to provide a detailed answer to the reporter's question about his injury.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I expected to win going out there. That's for sure. But I mean, it's only a learning process when you do lose a match. And it was such a long time ago. We were in very different places in our careers. And I was also in a totally different place for myself. I mean, really, I can only speak for myself. And just the circumstances I was under in 2015 was not the best for me personally. So now, I mean, I'm playing with a lot better. I guess rejuvenation would probably be a good word. Belief and desire to compete at the highest regard.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I knew I had to play my best and play within myself. I know she's going to do the same. So it's sort of a new match, new surface for both of us. And I just really wanted to come out here and try to take control of the match early on and do what I can.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I did come into today's match with some expectations. I had been preparing for it for a while and was hoping to perform well. However, it's always difficult to predict the outcome of a match, especially when you're up against a talented player like Eugenie.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the video, I can infer that they are slightly reflective and calm. Their relaxed posture suggests they are not immediately defensive or anxious about the question. However, their expression may also convey a hint of uncertainty or contemplation, possibly reflecting a mix of confidence with a bit of introspection regarding their past performance.

**He/She will say**: "I came into today’s match focused on playing my best. Of course, facing Eugenie after that loss in 2015 does carry some weight, but I try not to carry any expectations. It’s about staying in the moment and playing my game."

        <legend>Question 3（ID 305）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>So and so. I can say I had a feeling that even if I didn't have so many matches before the tournament, I have a chance because the tennis was there, even with Barty. Even if I lost that match, I felt that I played a good level of tennis. But also I thought that it's going to be tough to win against Canepi because of all the reasons. But also I had in my mind that she didn't play since we were in the same position. But I didn't think that much about the result, to be honest. I just went with the flu and I tried just to not give up.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important to stay focused and not get too caught up in expectations. I knew I had a tough match against Spardi, but I didn't think too much about the potential outcomes or who else might be on my side. I just tried to stay present and give it my all on the court. As for facing Venus, I was surprised, but I'm always ready for a challenge. Confidence is key, but it's not everything. I learned a lot from that experience and it definitely helped me grow as a player.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know. I just took it day by day. For me, I think I have to focus on the present. And I played my next round, so that was important. After I finished my match, then I didn't think about the draw. Because I know I need to win the matches. But for sure, the next one is going to be more difficult. She's a top player and she's doing well. So I'm going just to go on court, to enjoy and to try my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Looking back, I can't say I had high expectations for the tournament. There were moments of uncertainty and low confidence, especially after the tough match against Spardi. However, as I progressed and saw the draw, my mindset shifted. I knew that to perform well, particularly against top players like Venus and potentially Serena, was a challenge. Despite the pressure, it was crucial for me to stay focused and committed to my game plan. It's hard to say if I expected to reach the third round, but I did my best to approach each match with determination and resilience.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Honestly, not really. I wasn’t feeling very confident at the start of the tournament, but I just took it one match at a time. It’s nice that things have started to click, and I’m happy to have made it this far.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's difficult man, during the tennis tournament, you know, it's late, it's late night and I'm gonna go to sleep, I'm gonna try to rest well, tomorrow I have to recover, so I have to practice, I'm gonna practice for almost around one hour and then I'm gonna do some work with my physio and try to be ready for the next day. So having called it one day in the middle is difficult to visit the city, by the way it's not the first time I've been at the annual Melbourne.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I usually stay around the hotel and focus on recovery and preparation, maybe spend some time with my team. Exploring the city is nice, but it's more important for me to conserve energy and be ready for the match on Friday night.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I'm going to stay around the hotel, so I have to recover and recover the body. I had a tough match today. Now I need to play again on Friday, another tough one. And then Saturday, just another one, and that's all. So I don't have time to explore the city. That's just a few days for me to get ready for the next match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I will definitely take some time to explore the city a bit before the big game. There's so much to see and experience in Melbourne, and I think it's important to get out and immerse myself in the local culture. However, I'll also make sure to manage my energy levels and rest well, as getting enough sleep and staying mentally fresh is crucial for my performance. So, a balance between exploring the vibrant city and preparing myself for the game would be ideal.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>First of all, thanks for staying in late or early for this press conference. I had to do a post-match of the part of my recovery program because I didn't feel so great in the last 20 minutes of the match or so. So we'll see tomorrow how the body reacts, but I'm confident I can recover and I can be ready for the next one. Was the injury? No, it was not the fall. It was not particularly the fall. It was just a little bit of fatigue, a little bit of back, but nothing major. But there are a couple of things that have surfaced, so to say, after a match like this. But as I said, I'll see how it goes tomorrow.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I'm very pleased. I think I played really well. Obviously I was a little bit nervous because it was my first match of the year, but I felt like I really executed the game plan that I had and I've been working on for months. So I knew that if I stuck to my game, if my opponent didn't take advantage of any of my mistakes and they didnae, it's going to be a pretty good match for me.

Even though I had a few matches that went more than three hours, but overall feeling really good. I think I played great tournaments so far with my level of tennis. I think I improved it comparing to the end of the last year. I'm playing much, much more aggressive. I'm feeling that I am, from most of the shots, hitting them really, really good from the return, moving, forehand back and serving. I think everything is in good solid spots. So, feeling really excited by the final two.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Um, you know, I've been serving well this since the start of this year. I spent a little bit more time, um, working on it in the off season. I got to just hit more, serve that didn't do anything differently, but, uh, there was no direct reason, but served well in my first three matches. I've been consistently serving well. And today I think it's a little bit quicker here. Now that helps me as well, especially if you hit your spots.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've been doing it for years. That's just my style. I'm just very particular and I like to be very specific and detailed. And I just like the way I do it, it's very different than most people and that's why I think a lot of people like it because they're very much like me and they know that it makes sense. So I don't really know, I mean, that, you know.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern, and I appreciate your observation. It's true that I've been in situations where I had to take a break. Tonight was no different. I felt the need to step back and gather my thoughts before continuing. It's important for me to stay focused and composed throughout the match, and sometimes that means taking a moment to regroup. I hope you can understand that decision, and I'm grateful for your support.
