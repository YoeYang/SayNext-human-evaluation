        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know why I should feel more pressure. I'm just in quarter-final, so again, it's a big surprise that they're not in the draw anymore. But my next match is the quarter-final. I'm not thinking about some year final, that I will not have to play Andy or Novak. If I am in the final, that's my least thing, but the last thing I have in my head so far is a big match in quarter-final. It's for sure opening the draw on the other side. With Novak not here, you will have a finalist who is going to be interesting to see who is going to get there. But you have some big players there. You have Nadal, you have Rodgers playing now against Nishikori. So I just think it's an interesting tournament.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, no, not really. I think for me, it doesn't change anything. My focus is on my game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't feel any pressure at all. I'm just going to go out there and enjoy it. It's been a while since I've been able to play on Rod Labor. So it's a nice court to come back to and just enjoy the atmosphere and try to get a win out of it, but I have to work for it and I'll be all right.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, not really. Pressure is part of the game, and I try to focus on my performance rather than external expectations.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, no, it's just that I'm feeling more confident for the moment against the top players. I had a lot of matches before the tournament and I knew that I was able to fight and to win some matches against big guys. I knew that I had the level and the key was to play my best tennis in a match and not only during practice, but I'm doing more often than in the past. So that's why I'm more confident and I win some more matches.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> ** "Yeah, it's definitely been an interesting few weeks with some big upsets. It shows that in tennis, anything can happen, and anyone can make a deep run if they're playing well. I think there's a lot of players out there who will feel like they have a chance now. It's exciting for the sport, and it keeps us all on our toes."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's very similar to other slams, to be honest. I don't think there's anything different here compared to the other Grand Slams. And that's why it makes the slam, you know, it really is unique and it is special. So I'm not really thinking about it.
