        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was a tough match. Obviously, N'Yul was always going to be tough. He's been playing great. I think with him, he hasn't even found his best form yet, and he's still getting through all these matches, which is just pretty frightening. I think once he finds his feet and he has more confidence, he's going to get a real chance at winning it. Yeah, I thought I was only a couple of points in it. There wasn't like a got to mollusk out there or anything. I had a lot of chances to win the match, and I just came out short. Obviously, it's frustrating, but here's what it is.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a tough match, but we managed to come out on top. The snow brawl added an extra layer of challenge, but it also brought us closer together as a team. We learned to adapt and work together in difficult conditions, which will definitely help us in the future.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the provided video and images, it seems they may feel a bit uncomfortable or uncertain about the question. Their body posture is slouched, and their expression appears neutral to slightly strained, indicating potential frustration or confusion.

He will likely respond with something along the lines of:

**"I’m not sure what you mean by that. Could you clarify? I don’t think I’ve experienced anything like that before."**

The response would reflect their attempt to understand the question and either ask for clarification or redirect the conversation based on their body language.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Before the snow brawl, we assessed the situation by closely observing the behavior of all individuals involved. We monitored their actions and interactions to ensure everyone's safety and maintain order. This allowed us to quickly intervene and prevent any escalation of the conflict.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>He's, you know, I'm sure he's not going to really think about that so much. He's obviously happy to be in the second round. And he's definitely a tough player. You know, he's put up a lot of fights against a lot of good players. I remember him playing Rafa, I think in New York a couple of years ago. He was up a set in a break. So he's definitely dangerous. He's going to bring the match to me on Thursday, right? We play Thursday, yeah. Yeah, it's definitely going to be another good match for me. But I think if I play like today, I'll definitely have a chance to be dictating to kind of lead the game. So I'm really happy with where I am right now. And just going to try to take it to Tarot.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, definitely. When an opponent retires in the middle of a match, it can certainly boost a player's confidence and create a sense of momentum. It's a unique situation that can make a competitor feel more empowered and potentially more dangerous in subsequent matches. However, I believe that the real challenge lies in maintaining that momentum and not letting it get to your head. The key is to stay focused and disciplined, and to not let the outcome of one match define the rest of the tournament.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, for sure. I think every match is different, and just because his last opponent retired, it doesn’t mean he can’t come out really strong. I’ll stay focused on my game and take it point by point.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I don't want to say that he's got a free hit now. I think he played well in the last round and a half. He beat Cilic, which is a good win. So I'm not really focusing on the opponent. For me, it's another match. It's a tough match, another opportunity to win another round. And I just want it to go my way.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Sabaloka's serve is incredibly fast and powerful, making it difficult to anticipate and return effectively. The spin on her serves also adds a layer of complexity, forcing me to adjust my strategy constantly. It's a real challenge to stay focused and react quickly enough.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it’s just the way she hits the ball—there’s so much pace and spin, and it’s hard to anticipate. Honestly, I was probably overthinking a bit in the first set, but once I adjusted my approach, it got better. She’s a great competitor.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't remember the ball, but I was frustrated that I didn't finish the game with the forehand cross. I think it was a 4-2-15, so I had the match point in my hand and I couldn't make it. And it's frustrating.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, you're right. Sabaloka's ball is quite challenging. It has a unique spin and trajectory that makes it difficult to predict and return accurately. I need to adjust my strategy and focus more on her serving patterns to counteract this.

Growing up, I've always felt a strong connection to the Australian Open, and it's where I've grown both as an athlete and as a person. The energy of the crowd, the competitive spirit, and the opportunity to showcase my skills on such a prestigious stage all contribute to my deep affinity for this tournament.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely nerves. I was very nervous before I went out there, but I mean, I knew I had to just go out and play my game and not think too much. And I think that's what I did well.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> You know, I definitely felt a bit nervous walking out there, but that's pretty normal for a first match. I'd rate it as a good start—there's always room for improvement, but overall, I'm happy with how I handled it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a mix of nerves and excitement. Walking out there, I felt a rush of adrenaline, but also a sense of focus and determination. I would rate it as a 7 out of 10 in terms of nerves. It's always tough to start a new season, but I'm glad I could get through it with a win.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I felt like I've been hit by the train in the first set and everything was too fast. So I didn't get scared about the first set because I knew I have a better level and I can play better if I stay there and I really start moving better and hitting the ball stronger. After the first set I got that fire inside myself and I said that now I start the match so it was much better. And game by game I felt that my level is growing and I had more confidence to go through it.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you so much for the question. It's great to hear that you enjoyed the game. The first set did go really fast, but I tried to stay focused and composed. For the second set, I knew I had to be more patient and strategic. I also tried my best to enjoy the moment and stay in the present.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the compliment. It was a great game, and I'm glad I could deliver in the second set. To be honest, I was a bit nervous at first, but I tried to stay focused and keep my mind on the game. I also had a lot of support from my team and fans, which helped me stay motivated. As for the joke, I don't think I have one ready right now, but I'll try to come up with something good.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, first of all, I think humor is a great icebreaker, so feel free to start with that joke! [laughs] Honestly, though, in the first set, I think I was overthinking and maybe putting a little too much pressure on myself. But during the break, I took a moment to reset, focused on my strategy, and reminded myself to enjoy the game regardless of the outcome. The crowd's energy really pushed me to give it my all in the second set!

So we're not too serious. I mean when we are on the bench or we can laugh, we can make jokes. But once we go and hit the balls then we are really into it. And that's good to have the good balance. And I think, yeah, technically, technically with Loïc, we are doing a great job. So I think she's just a great coach.</div>
