        <legend>Question 1（ID 193）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>She never really lets up, although I think she gets a lot of balls back. That's something that I had trouble with in the previous matches that I played against her. I was really happy with how aggressive I was. I was consistent, but I was looking to come forward. I played really well at the net, finished the balls off with a swing volley or a good volley. Something I've been working on and definitely improved in the match today. I did the second set to say the least, but I got through it. I did the job in two, and that's not something I did towards the end of last year. So I think that's an improvement.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a combination of our playing styles and how they match up. We both bring different strengths to the game, and it creates these intense rallies and moments where it's more about who capitalizes on key points. I enjoy the challenge, even though it's always tough.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The complexity in our match stems from our contrasting playing styles and strategic approaches. We both bring unique strengths to the table, and our ability to adapt and respond to each other's moves makes for a challenging and engaging match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a tough match because both of us have been playing well and are in good form. We both have a strong game and it's hard to predict who will come out on top. It's always exciting when the match goes down to the wire and we have to give it our all to win.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think for me it was important to find my rhythm in the beginning of the match because she hits the ball very hard and very flat and she's playing very aggressive so I needed to try to mix a little bit more and try different shots and I was able to do that and it worked well today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That's a great question. Honestly, I'm still trying to process everything that just happened. It was an incredible experience, and I feel so grateful for the opportunity to have played at such a high level. The atmosphere, the support from my team, and the energy in the arena - it all just felt amazing. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how well I played, but I know it was one of those moments that you remember forever.

It's the moment to be very happy. I have been a fantastic match in my opinion, very emotional. I think Grigor played great, I played great, so it was a great quality of tennis tonight. For me it's amazing to be through to the final of the Grand Aslam again, here in Australia, that is the first of the year. It means a lot to me. I feel a lot of the people here. They give me a lot of positive energy. I think I feel very happy to be part of this match. A rife moment in the fifth set that for sure I wanted to win, but I say to myself, I am giving my best, I am playing very well. If I lose, that's it. Grigor deserves to. I think both of us deserve to be in that final. It was a great fight and finally it was me. I feel lucky and very happy for that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know, I'm very tired. I've been on court for four hours and I just need to go to recover and go home. But I was happy with the way that I played. Even if I lost, even if the score was close, still I had a lot of chances and he just served better in the fifth set. So I cannot complain too much. And it's true that the last time I beat him was in US Open 2008. He was number one and it was a very different match because he was much younger and fresher and all the things that were happening in that match were different from what happened today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the kind words. It was a tough match, but I'm feeling good and focused on the task ahead. As for my experience with Berdasco, it's a memory I hold dear, and it motivates me to keep pushing forward. I believe in my ability to recover and perform at my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your kind words. I'm feeling a mix of relief and excitement after that intense match. It's been a long journey, but I have faith in my abilities to bounce back quickly. Reflecting on my past victories, like defeating Berdasco seven years ago, I remember the immense satisfaction and pride in knowing I could overcome challenges. Now, with renewed vigor and determination, my goal is to stay focused and work hard to ensure I am in the best possible position for future matches. Thank you again for recognizing my efforts and your support means a lot to me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. It was a tough match, very emotional. I remember that match against Verdasco very well—it was also very special for me. Of course, I was younger then, and things are different now, but I will try my best to recover and be ready for the next match. It’s part of the job, and I have a great team to help me with that.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Through rankings I've probably been the favourite of week but in my eyes it certainly was a very even match and Naomi played a great match and especially in times when I would have my nose in front she served great and came up with the good so I think sometimes you really just do have to tip your hat to your opponent.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a little bit different because I didn't expect to win today. I was just playing free and just trying to enjoy the match and it was a bit more pressure on the other side. But I mean, I still expected her to be playing really well and I don't think she did anything wrong. She played really, really good tennis today and deserved to go through.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, I think, actually, feeling like an underdog can be quite motivating. It makes you work harder and gives you a different perspective. I learned a lot from this experience."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's all about how you handle the pressure, whether you're a favorite or an underdog. It's not really different for me, but I know it can be for others.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> ...it's always a bit different when you're expected to win, but I try not to let that influence me too much. I focus on my game and do my best out there. Today just didn't go as planned, but I’ll learn from it and move forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, the elbow injury is still a challenge for me. I'm working closely with my medical team to manage it and ensure I can continue to play at my best. It's been a tough journey, but I remain optimistic about my recovery.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> So it's definitely something I'm managing. It's not something that's gotten worse. I feel like I've been able to play doubles. So if I wouldn't be able, I probably wouldn’t play. But it is something where I definitely have to manage it.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I kind of thought it was a good chance because I felt like probably he's going to have a couple of good sets. I was going to have a couple of good sets and if you can't defend them, you know, it gets split and then the match moves on and then you're deep into the match. So, yeah, I mean, I didn't expect him to play this well from the start and that put me on the back foot for the remainder of the match to some extent. But I was able to rest it back in my favour and got into the match myself and started to play the good sets I was talking about that I knew I could. The question was, could I hang with K till the very end and I was able to do that, so I'm super happy.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know, I was just trying to stay focused on the match and, you know... I knew that it was going to be a very tough one. I played against him many times, and he beat me in the US Open last year, so I know how it's going. So I just tried to take the opportunity, which I did, when I got the chance, especially in that fifth set.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I didn’t expect it to go that long, but K is a tough opponent, and I knew it would be a challenge. It’s always unpredictable in these kinds of matches.
