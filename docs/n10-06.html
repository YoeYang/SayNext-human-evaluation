I was super disappointed having lost last round of Qualies, but I found out less than two hours later than I got into Maine and was ecstatic about that. It's honestly a dream being here.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for having me here. My Wimbledon journey has been quite an adventure. Losing in qualifying was definitely a setback, but I used that as motivation. Playing against a defending champion is a dream come true, and I've been giving it my all. It's been a rollercoaster, with ups and downs, yet I'm grateful for every match and learning experience. I'll keep pushing forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was playing really well in qualies. I won three matches, and then I lost. And when I saw that I didn't play anymore matches here, so I decided to do the wild card. It was a good decision, because I'm here. So I think that was the most important for me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm really happy to be here at Wimbledon, and it's been an incredible journey so far. It's not just about the wins or losses; it's about how you handle each match and learn from every experience. I've been focusing on staying calm, playing to my strengths, and enjoying the process. Every game is a new opportunity to grow and improve.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's been quite the journey, honestly. After losing in qualifying, I didn't know what to expect, but I just kept working hard, focusing on each match. Beating the defending champion feels amazing, but I know there's still a long way to go. Every match is an opportunity to grow and learn, and I'm just trying to take it one step at a time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that you've uploaded several images and videos related to an athlete at a press conference. From analyzing the body language and facial expressions, I can observe that the athlete appears to be somewhat reserved but also processing the question with thoughtful consideration. The way they adjust their posture and touch their face suggests they might be reflecting on the moment or responding to some pressure or expectation.

Given the reporter's question, *"You must be happy with that,"* the athlete may respond with something like:

**"Yes, I'm really pleased with my performance today, but there's always room for improvement."**

This type of response would be typical of an athlete acknowledging a positive outcome while also staying focused on future goals. Would you like to explore more about interpreting body language in such settings?

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, absolutely. I think every match that you went, it gives you a certain amount of confidence. And I think the past months have been going a really good way for me, meaning positive and having good results. And I'm getting closer to some of my goals. And that is to definitely come back to top 10 and try to beat those guys on a regular basis. And I'm also a strong believer that I belong there, so I need to keep that. And with each match, of course, that gives me the confidence, but I don't have to forget what is a big picture.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it was a good start of the season, obviously, winning a tournament and beating a player that is in the top 20. It's always good to start the year playing good tennis and feeling confident. And then I just kept going and now I have four wins in a row. So I'm happy with that.

And as you mentioned, I think that middle weekend is quite popular within the crowds here in Australia, but also the other slams.

So the crowd is excited and we are too. Of course you want to see packed house anywhere you play.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, you do notice it. The energy is definitely different on those bigger days with the crowd so involved. It can be motivating or even overwhelming at times. During my match, when Dennis did that jumping back, the crowd’s reaction was amazing—it adds to the thrill of the game. I think we all feed off of that energy, whether we’re on the court or in the locker room.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>For me it was the moment like I walked into the match knowing that she was gonna do a lot of strange things, no offense. But it was just she was playing so well and I think I got overwhelmed and then early in the second set I tried doing things that I know isn't necessarily my game. Like I was trying to hit higher balls and I don't even practice doing that so it felt like such a waste. And then after a while I just started thinking that I'm in a grand slam. I shouldn't be sad. I'm playing against a really great player so I should just enjoy my time and try to put all of my energy into doing the best that I can on every point. So I think that's why I left.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think in that moment I just tried to tell myself to stay calm and keep fighting. Sometimes you just have to laugh at everything happening out there because it’s so unpredictable, and she was playing amazing. I wanted to focus on doing my best and not getting overwhelmed by the situation.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was laughing because I think I saw a replay of the point and I realized how I had like an awkward expression and it was just too funny to not laugh at that moment. But yeah, I mean, she's definitely a really tough player to play because she literally goes for every shot and she doesn't really care if she misses or not. So if you're not ready for that, you can get burned really easily.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, there was a moment during the second set where I felt like I was struggling, and I'm sure it showed on my face. But I quickly regrouped, focusing on what I could control. I tried to let go of any external pressures and just play my game. It's all about maintaining composure and not getting rattled by the opponent's actions.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was feeling really tense and nervous during that point, but then I saw the opponent make a silly mistake and it gave me a bit of relief. It reminded me that tennis is a game of mental strength and sometimes you just have to laugh at yourself and enjoy the moment. From that point on, I tried to stay focused and not let the emotions get the best of me.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, I mean, just really trying to get back, you know, winning a game again, because he came back from 3-2 maybe, and 1-4 straight. So for me, it was just really trying to break his momentum, you know. I tried to serve well, tried to get lucky a little bit, and I think I was able, it's exactly what happened, you know. I was able to get that first game and at least get on the board, and then from then on, you know, maybe momentum shifts a little bit, and that's exactly what happened. So I think experience helped me there a little bit, and also a little bit of luck. I felt like I needed it a bit tonight.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was trying to find a way around it, I mean it was an unbelievable rally. You know when you're down 4-1, 40-15, it's the worst situation you can possibly be in and he played a forehand down the line, he served well, you know, that's where you think it might be over, but then all of a sudden it wasn't and I got myself back into the match and you kind of have to ride the momentum, even if you've lost it for a little bit and just try to keep fighting, keep coming back and that was the key to the whole match really.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. Yes, at the beginning of the final set, Chilich did have a lot of momentum, but I remained focused on my game plan. I knew I needed to stay calm and not let the pressure get to me. My strategy was to play smart, not to make unforced errors, and to wait for my opportunities. It was a challenging match, so I had to be mentally strong and stay disciplined.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, at the start of the final set, I knew I had to stay focused. I could feel that Marin was playing well and building momentum, so my main priority was to stay calm and control my emotions. I just reminded myself to play my game, not get too caught up in the moment, and wait for the right opportunities to turn things around.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. At the beginning of the final set, I was focused on staying calm and composed. I knew that Chilich had momentum, so I had to dig deep and find a way to regain my composure. I focused on my breathing and visualized myself playing well. I also tried to block out any distractions and concentrate solely on the game. It was important for me to stay in the moment and not get caught up in the pressure of the match.

"Yeah, it's definitely hard. You always want to do your best and go as far as you can, but looking back, it was still a solid performance. I came in with high expectations and didn’t quite make it to where I wanted, but I’m proud of how I handled the pressure from last year. It’s a step forward, even if it doesn’t feel like that right now."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, it's a bit difficult to think about it because I'm still disappointed. But I think I can say that I improved a lot from last year and I just need to keep going. So I don't want to overthink about the results. I want just to focus on the process.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's certainly a challenge to see the positives when the results don't go as planned. However, I do believe it's important to reflect on the process and the growth that comes with competing at such a high level. While it can be difficult to look at the tournament objectively, especially given the disappointment, there is always something to learn and improve upon. I'm focusing on what I can take away from this experience and how I'll come back stronger next time.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I definitely would have liked to have served better today. I don't think I was able to fully maximize things on my end there. But I felt I actually did a decent job at neutralizing her serve. Given there's only so much she can do against a serve like that, but I thought I did reasonably well and still lots to improve on there as well. I felt that... And also I felt physically I didn't feel that I got pushed too far back, which I was quite happy about. But again, lots of things that I... Hopefully I'll get the chance to play her again and do a bit better.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I felt that my focus and determination were strong throughout the competition. However, there were times when I could have been more strategic in my approach and perhaps communicated better with my teammates. I'm looking forward to analyzing the footage and identifying specific areas for improvement in future matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel like my serving game has improved a lot this year. I've been working on my consistency and accuracy, and it's really paying off. As for things I can improve, I think I need to work on my backhand more. It's been a bit of a weakness for me in the past, but I'm determined to get better at it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think there's a lot of things that I did well. I was really focused on my game plan today. That was my main goal, and I thought I executed it pretty well today, which I'm really happy about. There's always things I can improve on. And I feel like I've improved a ton since my last match. So, you know, there are certain things, but overall I have to be happy with how I played.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think overall I performed well in certain areas, like my serve and my consistency in key points. However, there's always room for improvement. I'd like to work on my footwork and speed around the court, and maybe focus more on strategizing during the match. I believe there's always something to learn and build on, and I'm dedicated to making those adjustments.
