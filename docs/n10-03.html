        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's not that I don't want to talk about myself, but it's like every day we're creating a story about the surf. I talk a lot about the surf. I just try things to improve my game. And I talk with the team about the things, the aspects of the game that we can keep improving. And we try to make that happen. And with the surf, we change a few things, but nothing drastic, nothing traumatic. I think it's a good thing I had some time to work with it. And I'm happy, more or less, how the surf is working during the first official event that I'm playing.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I made some adjustments with my serve this season. While I can't delve into all the specifics, I focused on improving my speed and accuracy. I've been working closely with my coach to refine my technique, and it's been beneficial in delivering more powerful and consistent serves. It’s still a work in progress, but the initial results have been promising.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, the product is improved. The product was good. So that's the first thing. And then I just changed the shape of the head a little bit, like a couple of millimeters. I didn't want to change too much, because then it's going to be completely different. But I wanted to have a small change, just to feel a bit different from the other ones.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>She has a different approach than any female player I've met. She has this thing, you know, she's really... How can I explain it? She has a lot of confidence in herself. Like, really, she knows what she's doing on and off the court. She's a lovely person outside the court. And just this attitude that she has of, you know, shading to lose, and that's what makes her a great champion. That's what I noticed on the court. Even on the practice, she really wanted to do better than me, and that was, you know, unusual to see something like this from a female player. When she's playing against a male player, but yeah, I do respect a lot what she did in her career. And she has something different than the other players.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the provided video, it seems that he is deep in thought and possibly reflecting on his response. His eyes are slightly narrowed, and his mouth is slightly open, indicating that his mind is processing the question and formulating an answer. He appears to be listening intently to the reporter's question.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think what makes Serena truly special is her resilience and ability to consistently perform at the highest level for so many years. Beyond her incredible achievements on the court, she’s been a powerful symbol of determination and hard work and a role model for so many people around the world, inspiring not only athletes but everyone who watches her journey.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know, I mean, he's a legend of the game, a guy that has been through a lot, had a really successful career. And I think he still wants to compete at a high level. I've had the chance to practice with him, hit with a few other players. He's always very friendly, very open to talk, to hit. So I always had fun whenever I practiced with any of his coaches. But I can't say I'm the only one that he had that experience with, but I definitely can say that when he hits with me, it's very enjoyable.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I tried to mix it up a lot with the backhand, slice, drop shot, tried to be a bit more consistent than him at some points. And I think I did it really well, especially in the important moment, like in the last break, in the fourth set, I was very solid, I didn't make except one mistake, so that was I think the key.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I didn't have a plan. I just knew that I had to be aggressive. And I knew I was going to have to take risks. The first game, I missed my forehand by a couple of millimeters. He made a good return. But I made the right decision. Took a little bit of time and tried to swing through it. So I think that was the key. Just trying to keep the pace up and not let him get into the point.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm glad you brought that up. I definitely wanted to make sure he didn't have too much pace to work with. It's important to keep him guessing and not give him an easy opportunity to hit big shots. I think our game plan was effective in that regard, and we'll look to continue that strategy moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it was definitely a part of the game plan. We wanted to make him uncomfortable, not allow him to find his rhythm or dictate with the pace he usually likes. It was more about staying solid and neutralizing his strengths as much as we could.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Our defensive strategy focused on tight man-to-man coverage and limiting his opportunities to create plays. We aimed to reduce his effectiveness by cutting off passing lanes and minimizing his space on the court.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. It's true that the loss is disappointing, but I'm trying to stay positive. I believe that every match is an opportunity to learn and improve. While it's hard to see things go this way, I'll use this experience as motivation to do better in future matches. Smiling might be a challenge right now, as I acknowledge the frustration, sadness, and disappointment, it’s all part of the process. But I’m determined to keep pushing forward and not let this defeat define me. Thank you again for asking.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> *"I'm definitely feeling good about my performance so far. It's been a great run, and of course, facing someone like Kerber next would be a big challenge. But I'm ready to give it my all and take it one match at a time. I'm focused on continuing to play my best, and we'll see how far I can go."*

Based on the expressions and body language observed, it appears they are confident yet humble, prepared for the upcoming challenges but not overly cocky. The slight smile and leaning in suggest they are engaged with the question and ready for a serious answer, while still keeping a positive tone.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I've been playing really good tennis and I'm just enjoying the whole thing and just taking it day by day. I mean, I have a tough opponent in the next round. So I need to prepare for that match and then I'll see how I feel and we'll take it from there.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm really happy with how things have been going so far, and I feel confident about my abilities. While I know Kerber is a tough opponent, I'm focused on one match at a time and taking it one step at a time. I'm just trying to stay focused and enjoy the process of competing at this level.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the Davis Cup has always been a very significant event for the team, and the drama this week has only served to bring us closer together. We all understand that these challenges are part of the sport, but it's also an opportunity for us to bond and work towards our common goal. As for leading the squad, I'm honored to be a part and excited to contribute to the best of my abilities. The support and unity within the group are essential, not only in the matches but also in our preparation and strategies. I believe that we'll come out stronger from this experience, ready to face our next challenges as a united team.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I played a good match. I think he played well. The first set was really close, so many chances on both sides. But in the end, I was able to win some important points, and I broke in a couple of times. And then I served well, played some good points. He didn't have many return chances. So I had a lot of chances, broke his serve three times in that set. Then I finished in three hours.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Absolutely, thanks for the congratulations. The match was quite intense, especially considering the early rounds. I focused on maintaining a steady rhythm and capitalizing on my opponent's mistakes. It was a close call, but I managed to secure some crucial points. As for tonight's round, I'm preparing to step up my game even more. My strategy will be to keep the pressure on, stay aggressive, and continue to adapt to my opponents' tactics. Let's see how it goes.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I definitely agree with that. In comedy, there is a lot of pressure on the straight guy to keep it together while the funny guy can be more out there. But I enjoy that role. It's challenging, but it's also a fun dynamic to be a part of.
