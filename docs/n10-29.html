              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean I definitely did learn a lot. I've played a couple matches now against players that are in the top 20 in my ranking. And I'm getting better and better. So yeah, that's the most important.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a tough match, and I learned a lot from playing against Top Rankers like Federer and Jukobichi. I saw how they handle pressure and stay focused during the match. I also compared my game to theirs and realized that there's always room for improvement. I'm grateful for the experience and will continue to work on my game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I learned a lot from my matches against top-ranked players like Federer and Jukobichi. Their techniques and strategies were truly impressive, and it was a great opportunity to see how they approach the game. I tried to observe their movements closely and see if I could incorporate any of their strategies into my own play. Comparing myself to these top players was challenging, but it also motivated me to work harder and improve my skills.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It’s been an incredible experience to compete against top players like Federer and Jukobichi. From these matches, I’ve learned a lot—mainly how they handle pressure and their ability to stay composed in critical moments. Their mental toughness is something I definitely admire and aspire to develop in my own game. As for comparing, I don’t focus too much on that. Every player has their own unique style, and it’s more about learning from them and pushing my own limits.

Yeah, obviously the shoulder hasn't been much of a secret in the past year. That's been something I've been struggling with and had to shut down the season after the U.S. Open.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's been quite a challenging period dealing with the injuries, but I'm really glad to be back on the court and competing again. This wind today, while it may have presented some difficulties, also brought a new level of challenge that I've been eager to face. It means a lot to me to have the opportunity to play, and I'll do my best to overcome any obstacles.

I don't know if I've played more than that. So it's great. It's so nice to be part of it, unfortunately. Not the way that I wanted things to be, but...

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the images provided, it appears that they are feeling a bit reflective and focused. Their posture is somewhat slouched, and they seem to be processing the question before giving an answer. This could suggest they are being cautious in their response, possibly taking a moment to gather their thoughts. Given this, the athlete might say something like:

**"It's definitely up there, but every win brings its own significance. This one was special for sure."**

They seem to be taking their time to acknowledge the importance of the victory while also reflecting on its place in their career.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, um, I was really focused on maintaining a positive mindset and staying aggressive from the beginning. I wanted to make sure I played with confidence and took control of the match early on. My tactical approach was to focus on my serve and to keep moving forward, capitalizing on any opportunities that arose.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was trying to enjoy the moment because I knew that I'm going to have a tough match. I know she's a great fighter, great competitor and great player. So I really wanted to go out there and play my game and try to really enjoy it. And I think I did a good job today.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, I have this inside myself, but previous years I gave up a lot during the matches and now I have maybe one or two years that I changed that thing. And that's why maybe I'm where I am now. I like to fight till the end and to play with no regrets. So after the matches, if I don't give up, I feel happy even if I lose the match. So everything I have in my mind is just to stay there for every point and to play it 100%.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a combination of both instinct and conscious decision. There are moments where I naturally want to keep pushing and fighting, and then there are other moments when I consciously decide to give it my all. It's really a mix of the two.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think it’s a combination of both. There are moments when instinct takes over, especially in high-pressure situations, but I also have to constantly remind myself to stay focused and fight for every point. It’s something I’ve worked on a lot over the years, and I’m happy I was able to pull through today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a mix of both, but I think that I have a fighting mentality, I never give up. I always believe that there is a chance for me to win, and I believe until the last point. And yeah, it's also a lot of belief and fighting spirit, which I had today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a combination of instinct and conscious decision-making. In those moments, my body takes over, but I'm also aware of the situation and make adjustments accordingly.
