        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Don't think of something extra ordinary like watching statistics and doing that kind of stuff. No, I didn't do that. I was just watching matches and trying to understand the patterns and the way and the mental side as well, the way that the thing in the court, because these players, I mean, they're the best example if you want to make it big in the game. So in that way, I meant analyzing. I didn't, not too much, not expert level, you know. Just by watching matches, highlights, I mean, there are great players to watch him, Rafa Djokovic, very good examples of how to improve your game. And I'm pretty sure it helped me.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I've always been fascinated by Roger Federer's game and his ability to adapt to different surfaces. From a young age, I would watch his matches on TV and try to analyze his movements, strategies, and shot selection. I would also study his physical conditioning and mental approach to the game. My research focuses on understanding how elite athletes like Roger prepare for tournaments, manage their emotions during matches, and maintain their performance under pressure. I believe that by studying these aspects, we can gain insights into what makes them successful and potentially apply those principles to other sports.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, from a young age, I admired Roger Federer for his game, his mentality, and how he approached tennis. I tried to learn everything about him, from his technique to his on-court behavior. Over the years, I’ve studied how he moves, how he adapts to different opponents, and how he handles pressure. This helped me understand the intricacies of the sport better and build my own game. It's not just about the technical side; it's about the mental aspect too, how to handle situations on the court. I think the more you analyze, the better prepared you are for facing top players.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've been analyzing tennis for a long time, even since I was a child. My studies include watching and breaking down the techniques and strategies of my opponents, trying to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This analysis helps me develop my own game and prepare for matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm just trying to do some stuff that I haven't done before. I mean, I've always been watching a lot of tennis and watching the greats. But I never really dug deep into it, you know, and really tried to understand what they were doing and why they're doing it. And I feel like that's been something that has helped me a little bit. Just trying something new and you never know what you're going to get from it and what I'll get is obviously going on the court and trying and hopefully getting better.

And I was happy to win the first set, and then I just felt a little bit uncomfortable, and I just thought, take some precaution of what happened in Brisbane in the next days. And then I took the medical time out, and I came a little bit unfocused to the court, and it took me a couple of games to get into the match again, but it was good that I could turn it around in that second set, even though it was for a one down.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was indeed a challenging match, and I wasn't at my best physically. The injury has been a concern, but I'll need to assess it further to see how it affects my performance moving forward. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think it was a weird match. I felt... I was struggling a bit with my movement due to the injury, but I tried to push through it. The atmosphere was quite unusual, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Despite the challenges, it definitely kept me on my toes and made me think a lot about my strategy and approach.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I felt that my foot was a little bit bad but I didn't know what's going on. And she was also not moving well. So I think we both were struggling with the foot issues. But I was not worried about my movement, about how I'm going to move. I just went out there and said, OK, this is it. This is what I've been working for and this tournament.

And then I decided to stop to be honest. But I will try to go back to practice tomorrow and then we'll see. If I can play, if I cannot, I need to play. So I hope to continue playing.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It looks like you've uploaded an image, but I can't directly interpret videos or analyze real-time body language and facial expressions from images. However, if you can describe the athlete's facial expressions or body language in more detail, I can help make a prediction based on those cues! Could you share some specific details about their current expression or posture?

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's going to be a really interesting match. We've played a couple of times. I won against her in the US Open, but it was a close match, and I know she's playing really well. She's a great player. So, yeah, it will be fun.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, when I didn't hit the first serve, she was pushing me, so I was just trying to hit the first serve. But even I hit few times, even there was the stun on one side, so we were both losing the games in the third set on this side, on the right side, so that was kind of tough to serve from there. But yeah, I think she all situations handled a little bit better than me today and was more aggressive, that's why she won.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's definitely a challenge to stay focused and composed when things don't go as planned. But I try to take each point one at a time and focus on the next serve, rather than dwelling on the previous one. Mental toughness is key in these situations.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely frustrating at times. It disrupts my rhythm, and I felt like I was struggling to get into a flow, but I tried to stay focused and not let it affect me too much mentally.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. It's challenging when things don't go as planned. I try to stay positive and focus on the next play. Mentally, it can be tough, but I know it's part of the game. Every athlete has bad days, and I'm no exception. The key is to learn from those experiences and keep moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, I think I was serving well. I felt like I had a good serve percentage, so I wasn't really thinking about that. But yeah, of course, you always want to get in rhythm early. So I wish I could have gotten in a little bit earlier, but I don't think it was a huge deal.

It was the first match back for me at a slam, so I was just kind of happy to focus on my side and see where I was at.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. Losing to Yanko four times in past tournaments was definitely in my mind. It was a motivating factor for me to work harder and prepare better for this year's Australian Open. I knew I had to do better than before, and I'm glad that all the hard work paid off today."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, we've had a lot of battles and yeah, he's always been someone that's been able to raise his game when we play each other. And I've been playing well against him. I have a good record against Rafa. But it's never easy. You know, it was a big challenge for me. This was, you know what it is. It was the beginning of the year. So, yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. It's always a challenge when you've faced someone multiple times before, but I approach each match as if it's the first time. Yanko is a tough opponent, and I knew he would bring his best game today. I'm focused on what I can control and not dwell on past matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. To be honest, it was definitely on my mind because losing to someone multiple times can be a mental hurdle. But I tried to focus on this match and stay confident in the work I’ve been putting in. It feels great to have finally overcome that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, it definitely feels different. Being away from the family for such a long time and then coming back to this event is a unique experience. It's been a lot of time since I've been here, and there's a sense of nostalgia mixed with the excitement of being back.
