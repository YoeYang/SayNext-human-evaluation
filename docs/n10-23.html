              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was just one of those days where everything didn't quite click. I'm usually pretty confident, but today I felt a bit off. Maybe it was the conditions or something else, but I just couldn't seem to get into my rhythm. I've been working hard on my game, and I know I can be more consistent than that. It's frustrating, but I'll learn from it and come back stronger next time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Today I tried to be aggressive and keep the pressure up, using my forehand to move her around and force her into mistakes. I know that’s one of my strengths, and I wanted to make sure I was taking control of the points.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I tried to be more aggressive than her, but I couldn't find the rhythm. I didn't play well. So I was trying to find my way, which I wasn't able to do it. But yeah, I just need to improve.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Today, I tried to incorporate a more aggressive and powerful style of play. However, it seemed to disrupt my usual rhythm and technique, making it challenging to execute my shots effectively. I'll need to work on finding the right balance between power and precision.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's great to be back on this court after such a long time. Winning that match a couple of years ago was a significant moment for me, and it's incredible to see how far I've come since then. Today's match was intense, but I felt confident going into it. I've been working hard to improve my game, and it shows in the way I played today. I'm really proud of myself for how well I handled the pressure and delivered a strong performance. It's always important to keep pushing yourself and striving for improvement, and that's exactly what I did today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't want to overthink too much. I just want her to play her game and I'll play mine. So it's that simple. What are your chances? I have a good chance. She's a great champion. No one's ever been in this position. It's going to be a lot of pressure on both of us. But I'm just excited.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I think Serena is a tough competitor, but I believe I can take advantage of her movement around the court. If I focus on hitting deep, fast shots, I can force her to make mistakes. It's all about maintaining the pressure and staying consistent. I'm ready to give it my best shot!" 

This prediction is based on the athlete’s smiling and relaxed demeanor, suggesting a confident but respectful response to the reporter's question.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know why I should feel more pressure. I'm just in quarter-final, so again, it's a big surprise that they're not in the draw anymore. But my next match is the quarter-final. I'm not thinking about some year final, that I will not have to play Andy or Novak. If I am in the final, that's my least thing, but the last thing I have in my head so far is a big match in quarter-final. It's for sure opening the draw on the other side. With Novak not here, you will have a finalist who is going to be interesting to see who is going to get there. But you have some big players there. You have Nadal, you have Rodgers playing now against Nishikori. So I just think it's an interesting tournament.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I definitely feel more pressure now. The combination of "done," "no layout," and "end layout" indicates a critical phase of the project, and the weight of expectations is palpable. It's crucial to ensure everything is perfect under these circumstances.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It is indeed challenging as a tennis player to live up to the expectations set by the quote. The pressures of performing at a high level can be overwhelming, but it is our duty to push through these challenges and continue striving for excellence.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the quote is something that really resonates with me. It reminds me of the dedication and strength required to compete at this level. As a tennis player, it's not easy, especially when you're under pressure. But you have to focus, push yourself, and embrace the challenge. It’s about having the mindset to stay strong mentally, no matter what the situation is. I think the quote encourages me to just keep going and believe in my ability to do my best, even when things are tough.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's pretty much obvious when I'm playing. I can't say that I will win. So it depends what I do. It depends on how I play and what's my opponent doing. And I feel like I have to do that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's going to be a tough match, no doubt. But I'm focused on my own game and what I need to do to perform at my best. Serena is an incredible player, and she always gives it her all. We'll see how things play out on the court.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've had two matches with Serena last year, and each one was quite intense. If she were to come through, I would definitely prepare for a challenging match. Losing to her twice last season has certainly given me a lot to think about, especially in terms of her desperation to beat me. I expect that it would be a difficult match, but I'm ready to face her head-on. It's going to be an interesting encounter, that's for sure.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think every match is different, and I just try to focus on playing my best regardless of the opponent. Serena is an incredible player, and if it comes to that, I'll focus on executing my strategy and staying in the moment rather than thinking too much about previous matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I mean, yeah, if she's playing her best tennis, she plays really well. And, you know, it's, like I said, we haven't played each other for a while, so I don't really know what to expect. But, um, well, hopefully I can play my best. Yeah, that's all I got to do.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I just tried to play better. I mean, there were moments where it looked like maybe she had the match, but at that time, I kind of forgot the score and just focused on my game. And that's a great part about tennis, is that the clock doesn't run out.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I just had to stay patient and trust in my game. Sometimes, it's about adjusting and finding a rhythm, especially when things aren't going as planned. I made sure to stay calm and just focus on the next point.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the key change was in my mental approach. Initially, I was struggling with some technical issues, but I managed to shift my focus and stay composed. This helped me regain my rhythm and make some crucial plays. It was a turning point in the match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've been playing tennis for a long time, and I know how important it is to have a strong mindset. When things don't go as planned, you have to adapt quickly and focus on the next challenge. This draw might seem daunting, but it's also an opportunity to prove myself in new situations. I'm ready to seize this chance and give it my all.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, maybe I felt a little bit bad because I was late coming here and I said one thing you have to do, not giving up. So maybe that's why I stayed there for every ball. Actually it was, I think, the best match that I played in the last period, not giving up for one ball. So I think I improved in that direction and I'm just happy that I could win. Nothing else. It doesn't matter anything because I'm not at the highest level, my tennis. So I'm just trying to feel good on court and to improve day by day.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just kept telling myself that I can’t give up, no matter how hard it is. It’s tough, but I know I have to stay strong mentally. Every match has its ups and downs, and today was no exception. But I just had to push through, even when it felt like things weren’t going my way.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Because I've been in this situation before. I know how it feels. And I knew that she's not going to give me the match. So I thought that I have to do whatever I can to win the second set and to stay in it.
