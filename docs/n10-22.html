        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I mean, I was in a very positive time. And I just tell myself, you know, it can continue. If you stay stable, you know, in your mind, you know, you can continue to win all those points. And that's what I did. So, yeah, it was surprising also for me to win this match. But I was, I believed in it. So that's why I won.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> You know, it's an amazing atmosphere out there. The crowd is always amazing. You always feel like you're playing in front of the biggest crowd, even if you play in the middle of night. I mean, that's what makes tennis special, because you can play a match in a big stadium in Australia, in Rod Labor Arena, with a lot of people, and you feel the support, you know. And it was, yeah, the crowd was amazing today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That was a really nice shot, and it was cool to see the crowd's reaction. It was a great feeling to be able to execute that play and get the point.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That was a really good feeling, to be honest. It's not something you see every day in a match, so it's definitely a moment you remember. When you execute something like that, especially in front of such an electric crowd, it gives you a lot of confidence. Knowing that you can pull off a move like this in the moment, and then the crowd reacting, you feel like you're on top of the world. From that point on, I knew that I could rely on my skills and trust in my abilities to make more impactful plays.

        <legend>Question 2（ID 224）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Playing the time that I played on court, I really don't care. If you play like the match that I played against Nimitrov in 2017, it's better to have two days. I can't lie to you. But today have been less than two hours, I think. So it's not an issue to have one day or two days.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I can't say that I prefer one day off or two days off. I would say, you know, it's a little bit different for every player. Some players, they like to play two, three days in a row, playing every day. And some other players prefer to have more days. So it depends on the moment, on my physical situation, because I know that if I am not at 100%, if my body is not feeling well, then I need to take more time off to recover, to be ready for the next round. That's what I did in the past, and that's also what happened this time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the provided video, it seems that he is thinking about the question carefully. His posture is relaxed, and he appears to be considering his response. He might be reflecting on his experiences and routines in tennis tournaments. Considering his thoughtful expression and the way he seems to prepare to speak, he will likely provide an answer that reflects on both his mental preparation and routine in tournaments, possibly discussing how different scenarios  have affected him.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> For me, it doesn’t matter too much. I just try to adapt to the schedule and focus on my preparation. Of course, it’s always nice to have rest, but at the same time, more rhythm can also help. So, for me, honestly, I take it as it comes.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It was a great fight today. I think for both of us we left everything on court. It was very hot actually. Last night when I checked the weather it was 20 degrees max so I didn't really expect that it's going to be that hot. Of course we played a long match so I'm very pleased that I could get the win today.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels amazing to come through that match. I think the difference was staying focused and believing in myself, even when things weren’t going my way. I just kept fighting and managed to turn it around.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a good fight, a big fight. It's not easy to come back from 4-2 down the second set and it's even more difficult to win in the third set. So I'm very happy to be in front of the ball in five sets and I had to fight for it. But it was really tough to start the match because I was not there. I just didn't have the energy and power. And I felt like I didn'y have anything to give. Maybe that's why I lost the first set because she played great tennis and then I kind of went away from me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels incredibly rewarding to come through that match. The difference in manufacturing the comeback lies in my mental fortitude and the resilience I have developed over the years. Facing adversity head-on and pushing through to victory is a testament to the hard work and dedication I've put into my training and mindset.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels great to come through that match, and I think the key was staying focused and not giving up. I knew I had the ability to make a comeback, and I just trusted in myself. It was tough going at times, but I managed to find my rhythm and capitalize on my opponent's mistakes. I'm proud of how I handled the pressure and stayed composed when it mattered most.

When everybody was saying I wasn't ready and not fit, obviously I proved that the first round was very high quality tennis for me. Yes, I was happy with the whole match, the whole day.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm really proud of myself for getting to the final of the very next slam after what happened in Beijing. It's been a challenging journey, but it's all part of my growth as an athlete. I don't want my career to just be defined by one term, so achieving this milestone is significant. However, I know there's still a lot of work to do and more goals to reach. This is just the beginning.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I definitely feel that. Lindsay's support and confidence in me mean a lot, and it's definitely encouraging to hear that from her. I'm feeling really positive about my performance and the direction I am heading in.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I feel that way too. I think the way I’ve been playing and the progress I’ve made really shows that I’m getting closer to where I want to be. It’s about taking it one step at a time, staying focused, and trusting the process.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> You were playing really well. Do you feel like your game is coming together? I think my game was coming in New York, but I was just getting a little bit better every match. And I feel really good in my second match here. So I'm just trying to build on that.

        <legend>Question 8（ID 225）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No, it is relevant and it's normal that you believe that you have doubts about me because I have doubts about me, you know? It's not, of course, it's not a problem for me and I really understand 100% because I have the same doubts but it's true that if that happens 10 years ago, probably will be a much more difficult situation for me because I needed always to be on rhythm to play with the tennis. Since a while I understand that that's, of course, it's better because you feel more confident on yourself, you feel more safe when you are on rhythm but, you know, I believe that when you are older, you lose less the tennis when you are playing less, you know? You don't need that many matches to play well and that's something that happened for the last two years for me and probably one of the reasons is because I am practicing well when I am not competing and that then allows me to be back on action a little bit quicker. That's all, you know, it's not a big reason and, of course, it's an issue. It's not easy to be back after four months or five months and play the way that I am playing. Of course, I didn't expect that at all. Sorry, I forgot to answer two more questions.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it’s normal people talk about these things and analyze them, but honestly, every player is different. For me, I’ve been preparing well. It’s not about how long I’ve been away, but how I feel now. I’m here to compete, and I feel ready. Let’s see what happens.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think that it's not that I'm relevant, I've been playing well the last few weeks. I have been focused on my own things, my recovery, how I feel on the court, and I was playing a good level of tennis. So I don't care if people say I am or I not relevant. That's a little bit dangerous. If you believe in that, because I believe that if you are not on court and you don´t practice every day, you can be very good. And I would like to see that happening to me. It's going to be great for me, but I can't really be that naive and that blind. You know, it has to go step by step.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your perspective, but I've been working hard during this time to prepare for this event. My focus has been on my training and improving my game. I believe that my dedication and preparation will show in my performance, regardless of the time since my last official event.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Now, and I'm a little bit further from that emotional craziness when you lose a point and you get upset a little bit. So I'm taking that a little bit from a distance and try to analyze less. Just go for the next point and keep in mind only positive messages because if I have negative it's not going to work. So I think basically simple stuff.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't want to say. I just try to focus on the present and try not to think too much about what's going to happen next or what has happened. So I try my best to stay in the moment and to be as relaxed as possible.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's all about being in the moment and not getting too caught up in the outcome. I try to focus on the process rather than the result, and that helps me stay calm and composed.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I definitely have a different approach now. Before, there were moments where I felt overwhelmed and panic started to set in. However, over time, through practice and experience, my mindset has changed. Now, when I feel the pressure rising, instead of succumbing to panic, what helps me stay composed is focusing on deep breathing and reminding myself of my training and preparation. This mental shift has been crucial in maintaining composure during high-pressure situations, as opposed to the more chaotic thoughts I had in the past.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think she's a very unique player. I mean, I've known her since we were juniors, so I know how she plays and how long she hits and stuff. But I don't know, she just seems like she has a lot of confidence and she does like a great job of going for her shots and just kind of not thinking too much about it. So I feel like that's something that she excels herself.
