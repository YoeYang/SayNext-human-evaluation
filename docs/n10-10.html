        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I felt pretty good since the start. I felt good during the warm-up before the match today. I felt the ball really well. I just knew I had to stay aggressive with her and not giving her much time. That's what I did. I'm happy that it was working for me as well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think I was controlling the points and playing really well from the beginning. And I felt really good on court, so I just wanted to keep the pressure on her and just keep going and keep being aggressive.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was feeling pretty good, but I know it was a tough match. I had to really focus and stay in the zone. It's always a challenge to maintain that level of intensity throughout a match, but I'm glad I was able to pull through.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I definitely felt like I was in control for the entire match. My confidence was high from the start, and I think that helped me maintain my pace and play with such intensity. The quick start in the first set gave me momentum, which I carried into the second set. It's always a great feeling when you're able to dominate the game like that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I felt like I had control throughout the match. I came in with a clear game plan, started strong, and kept the momentum going in the second set. It was important to stay focused and not let up at any point.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, as you said, it was a good start. I had a good chances, you know, a couple set points, but then, you know, I mean, I think he just gets more confident after he saved the first set. And then it was very difficult with him again, because it's, you know, he was after basically being all set down, you know, it gives you a lot of boost, and especially with him, most, I think that was just the deciding thing. So, you know, I mean, everything is if, but winning a first set then would be a completely different story.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for that observation. I think the key to turning around in the first set was maintaining my focus and composure even when I faced pressure. It was crucial to stay disciplined with my shots and to execute the game plan we had prepared. This allowed me to regain momentum and ultimately win the set. Thanks for asking.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think the key turning point was when my opponent started to find his rhythm, and I maybe lost a bit of my momentum. It became challenging to maintain the same level of intensity, and he played really well from that point on. I think he deserved the win today.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think he played a bit better than me in the second set. And I didn't serve as many as I wanted to in that set, but then I got broken again in a row. But I just wanted more and more. I was getting more tired, of course, and then he was playing better and better. So that's what happened.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Looking back at the last two or three weeks, it's clear that despite some setbacks, I've maintained the level of play I started the season with. The progress made has been steady, and while the results may not have been as favorable as hoped, there have certainly been positives to take away. It's crucial to analyze these weeks to understand where improvements can be made and how to better leverage the strengths that have seen me succeed earlier in the year.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I'm very happy with the way I started the season. I think I played some really good tennis and it's a great confidence for me to know that I can start the year playing this kind of tennis. And yeah, happy to be in the fourth round of a grand slam.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>in the way she's a great person and great player as she showed. I think it's not really easy to play quite a final of the slams at home. I know the pressure when I'm playing home as well, so it's not really easy. And she really played unbelievable tennis today as well. I mean, her slice was like two sentiments and then an ad and it was just really incredible what she's been through the whole tournament. I'm a bit sorry for her that I beat her, but that's the tennis, unfortunately.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, I didn't have time to put the strategy in the match. The strategy was to be aggressive, to try to be the one who is leading the point, but when he's playing that far from the baseline, 10 centimetres from the baseline all the time, it's tough to do it. So, yeah, as I said, I couldn't put the strategy in place.</div>

I mean, she played winners and she had answers for every single shot that I had in the first two sets, actually. And I mean, I was expecting that she's playing like this because I saw a little bit of the match against Agar. But I mean, I was just trying to doing everything and yeah, she played amazing. She was also moving good the first few sets. You know, it was tricky to play against her, but yeah, I'm happy that I won the second set and then I could play my tennis again in the third set. And I think, yeah, the key was that I was moving a little bit better at the end of the match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It’s definitely challenging. She has a very unique style of play, and it forces you to adapt constantly. Her shots may seem slow, but they’re incredibly precise, and that makes it tough to stay in control of the match. You really have to be patient and focused the entire time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was definitely a unique experience. I've never faced such slow winners before, it was a challenge to adjust my game plan and find ways to still be effective. But it's part of the sport, and I'm always looking to improve and adapt to whatever the game throws at me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was really difficult because I knew that she was going to play very aggressive and I had to be ready for it. But at the same time, I wanted to stay aggressive as well. And she did it very well today. She served very good and also stayed aggressive. I was a little bit surprised about that because the first two matches she didn't serve this way. So it was not easy and then I didn've been in this position before.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a combination of pressure and the intensity of the practice sessions. When we practice together before the tournament, we're constantly pushing ourselves to improve, which can create a high-pressure environment. Her speed definitely adds to the pressure, but we work together to manage it and make sure we are both performing at our best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "It's hard to say, but it definitely felt different out there. It's not just the speed, but the pressure adds up, especially when you’re not feeling 100%. Maybe it’s a combination of both." 

Given the athlete's slightly tense posture and the way they seem to be thinking deeply while touching their chin, the response will likely be thoughtful, perhaps uncertain, yet honest, indicating they are weighing the question carefully.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think that's a normal thing. You know, she hits the ball very strong and very fast. And when she's on the defense, then she can play very aggressive and she returns very well. So it's always tough to play against her.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's just the pressure of being in the tournament, you know? It's a big deal, and everyone's watching. But I'm trying to stay focused on my game and not let all that pressure get to me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> My mom. You know, my mom, yeah, she was there. My dad was actually there too, but my dad's super far away, you know. So it was just my sister and my mother. They were there, and it's always nice to have them around.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I feel great. But yeah, I'm obviously very excited just at the level that I was able to produce again on the match court. That's what it's been a bit about for me in the last, well, six to eight months at least. And I've been playing that level now for a while. And I've just been working to maintain and even improve on that day in, day out. And yeah, to find another little extra gear within myself out there with the crowd and with the energy on the court, and supporting the matches, it's a great feeling.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It ranks right at the top under the circumstances and playing against Nadal in such an important match. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing. Obviously back-to-back semifinals and finals to, I think, make 15 Come-first errors in total in two matches is quite pleasantly surprising to myself as well, even though I always believe I can play this way and kind of visualize myself playing this way. But, you know, at this level, as I said, under the circumstances, it was truly a perfect match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not sure I can answer that. I mean, I have had some good matches in Grand Slam finals. Obviously, this one was very special, one of the most special ones. It was against Rafa, which was a unique experience, and I was able to fight through it. But it's hard to compare, you know, because everyone is different. Every match is a little bit different, every opponent is good, but in the end of it, it was an unbelievable match today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> **  
*"It was a great performance, no doubt. But I don't like to compare them too much. Every final is special, and each one holds its own significance. I always strive to give my best, and that match was no exception. But, I think there have been other moments in my career that also stand out in their own way."*
