              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think that's normal. I always put a lot of tape on it. And I just didn't feel like that was really that bad. So I didnä¼t really think about it too much. But it was good.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It’s okay, just a precaution. I’ve been feeling it a bit more, so I added some extra tape to make sure it stays secure. Nothing to worry about; I’m managing it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Despite the challenging moments throughout the game, I remained confident in my abilities and experience. I knew that my skills and knowledge would be crucial against a younger, possibly less experienced opponent.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I didn't think that my experience was going to come into play. I thought that I was just going play the match like any other match, that there was no secrets. And I had to be ready for the first ball and play well and try to make him play what I wanted to play, and that's what happened.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I felt confident as the match progressed. Experience can be an advantage in moments like this, but I prefer to focus on playing each point as it comes rather than relying solely on my experience. The younger player was tough, and I had to stay focused throughout.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the facial expressions and body language in the provided images, the athlete appears thoughtful, slightly tense, and focused. His furrowed brow and serious expression suggest that he is reflecting on the match and the challenge it presented. Additionally, his body posture, slightly hunched, indicates a mix of introspection and readiness.

He will likely respond with something that acknowledges the tough competition while expressing a sense of confidence or determination. Given the context of the question, a plausible response might be:

**He will say**: "Yeah, I knew it was going to be a tough match. Dan was playing some great tennis, but I was prepared for a fight. I had to stay focused and play my best."

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>First thing that I did very well was that I stayed every ball there. I knew that she can come back. She did two times in a row when I played against her after I won the first set. So I knew that every ball is important. And if I take the lead in the second set more, then I'm going to break her a little bit physically and also mentally. So I did it well and also about the game. I moved her. I stayed there. I tried just not to miss that much. And I tried also to push her back, which I did. And she couldn't dominate the game. I did. I dominated. I went to the net a lot and I finished the points when I felt that it's time.</div>

A lot of people could read about it and stuff like that.

Because being number four in the world, normally people reach their limits. I'm number three in the world, and I still feel like I have so much room, and I still feel like I have so many kind of holes in my game where I can improve.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's body language in the images you've provided, it appears he is feeling either introspective or somewhat pressured. His gaze is downward, and he appears to be focused on his hands, which can indicate deep thought or possibly discomfort. His posture is slightly hunched, with his shoulders pulled forward, suggesting he might be hesitant or trying to gather his thoughts before responding.

Given the context of the question about his game and collaboration with his coach, it's likely that the athlete is taking a moment to reflect carefully before articulating a response. He may want to ensure he provides a thoughtful and meaningful answer.

He will likely say something like:

**"I've been focusing on improving my consistency, especially on my serve and return. Arden and I have been working on making my game more solid overall, focusing on minimizing errors in crucial moments."**

This response would align with his thoughtful demeanor, as he seems to be contemplating the best way to express his efforts and progress.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I can't say for certain what was weighing on both of our minds during the first game. However, I think it's safe to assume that both players were focused on their goals and the importance of the match. The pressure of playing for significant titles like my 15th and his 18th would certainly add an extra layer of intensity to the game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I don't know, because I had a tough match the day before. It was a long match and I was playing against John Isner, which was not easy, so I didn't have the chance to think about it. But I know that he is a fighter. He is competitive and he deserves it, but I think that I am also a good player. I played some good matches here in Australia and here, in Brisbane and Sydney. So I have a lot of confidence and my game is good. And I believe that if I keep working hard, one day I can win another title.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a lot of pressure, yes. We are both playing for something important, and sometimes that can weigh on your mind. I tried to focus on the game, but it's not easy when you're playing for such big titles.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No, it was a long time ago. It's a different match, it's a different moment for both of us. So I think this match is completely different than what happened before. So it's special, we have not been there in that situation for a while, so that makes the match different. I really don't think about what happened in the past. I think the player who played better is going to be the winner.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know. I just know that I have been playing well during the past weeks. That's the most important thing. And I hope to keep doing that. Well, I'm happy to be back playing again. It's a great start for me. So I cannot complain.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It definitely does have value. Having a better record against Roger is a significant advantage. When you step onto the court on Sunday, you know you have the edge based on our previous encounters. It boosts your confidence and provides a psychological advantage, which can be crucial in high-stakes matches like this one.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I don't think it matters much. Each match is different, and what happened in the past doesn’t guarantee anything in the future. Roger is a great player, and I know I will have to play at my best to have a chance to win on Sunday.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's always good to have a strong record against an opponent, but it's not the only factor that determines success in a match. I'll focus on my own game and do my best.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I'm just playing on the chords and getting a little bit used to it but not doing so much. I think I had a good preparation here with all the matches, the conditions I think are nearly the same. So I think not doing too much but just playing on the chords before I play one match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not sure I entirely understand the question, but I think you're asking about my training schedule and how I balance it with rest. It's always a challenge, but I try to make the most of my time to recover.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I understand your interest in my training schedule and the upcoming events. Rest and training are crucial parts of my preparation. After receiving my money on Monday, I will have a few days to rest before the next training session. This period is essential for me to regain my strength and focus. As for God getting used to me, it's a matter of discipline and perseverance. It's all about maintaining a routine and staying dedicated to my goals. Thank you again for your inquiry.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, I mean, just really trying to get back, you know, winning a game again, because he came back from 3-2 maybe, and 1-4 straight. So for me, it was just really trying to break his momentum, you know. I tried to serve well, tried to get lucky a little bit, and I think I was able, it's exactly what happened, you know. I was able to get that first game and at least get on the board, and then from then on, you know, maybe momentum shifts a little bit, and that's exactly what happened. So I think experience helped me there a little bit, and also a little bit of luck. I felt like I needed it a bit tonight.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was trying to find a way around it, I mean it was an unbelievable rally. You know when you're down 4-1, 40-15, it's the worst situation you can possibly be in and he played a forehand down the line, he served well, you know, that's where you think it might be over, but then all of a sudden it wasn't and I got myself back into the match and you kind of have to ride the momentum, even if you've lost it for a little bit and just try to keep fighting, keep coming back and that was the key to the whole match really.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. Yes, at the beginning of the final set, Chilich did have a lot of momentum, but I remained focused on my game plan. I knew I needed to stay calm and not let the pressure get to me. My strategy was to play smart, not to make unforced errors, and to wait for my opportunities. It was a challenging match, so I had to be mentally strong and stay disciplined.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, at the start of the final set, I knew I had to stay focused. I could feel that Marin was playing well and building momentum, so my main priority was to stay calm and control my emotions. I just reminded myself to play my game, not get too caught up in the moment, and wait for the right opportunities to turn things around.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. At the beginning of the final set, I was focused on staying calm and composed. I knew that Chilich had momentum, so I had to dig deep and find a way to regain my composure. I focused on my breathing and visualized myself playing well. I also tried to block out any distractions and concentrate solely on the game. It was important for me to stay in the moment and not get caught up in the pressure of the match.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was great. I mean, the stadium was full, a lot of Serbian, of course, but also a lot of French and a lot of Australian. So I think it was a nice final because I think the crowd was separate. And that was a good final anyway. So I have good memories. Of course, for me, it was, of course, disappointing to lose this one. But anyway, I was good memories. Before the come in 2008, I didn't expect to play a final. So it was already something nice, of course. I was not even seated, I think.</div>
