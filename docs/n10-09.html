        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I mean, he definitely made more turns than he did when he was up a break. I felt, granted, I got in a good service with him when I was down a break. He started serving cannons. I'm like, where was that at 0-0? But it is what it is.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I definitely felt good out there, you know? I just kept my focus and tried to stay aggressive from the start. It's all about finding that rhythm, but also making sure I stay consistent.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I'm getting used to it now. I mean, I've been in the third round now a couple times. And I feel like I can play well in that position and I still have a chance to win matches. So I don't really care about the temperature.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think you're right. It's important to adapt to different weather conditions during sports. When it's cold, it can take a bit more effort to get warmed up and ready to perform, but it also adds an extra layer of challenge and resilience. The key is to be prepared and mentally focused, no matter the conditions.

        <legend>Question 2（ID 232）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think it was another exceptional match for me. Obviously, Tara was a very tough opponent. I knew that going in and I knew it was going to be tough, so I'm really happy to get through that in straight sets. I wasn't expecting that to be honest. I felt in the second set he had a couple chances. I was able to play some big tennis, so I'm really proud today. And after I got that tie break in the second set, I knew that the momentum is kind of with me, so I just tried to stay on it, play a good game to break, and then just serve well. I think I've been serving really well the last couple days.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think, uh, it's all about staying focused when those moments happen. I try to not let them throw me off and just refocus when I need to. I know I can perform at a high level when it counts, so I just need to keep my confidence up and stay sharp.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>There's always nerves before any Grand Slam match, but especially when you haven't played any matches leading up to it. So I was definitely a little bit nervous and I felt like I had to just keep my feet moving and try to get all of that out, but after being able to kind of get a quickly, I felt a lot better.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely nerves. I was very nervous before I went out there, but I mean, I knew I had to just go out and play my game and not think too much. And I think that's what I did well.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> You know, I definitely felt a bit nervous walking out there, but that's pretty normal for a first match. I'd rate it as a good start—there's always room for improvement, but overall, I'm happy with how I handled it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a mix of nerves and excitement. Walking out there, I felt a rush of adrenaline, but also a sense of focus and determination. I would rate it as a 7 out of 10 in terms of nerves. It's always tough to start a new season, but I'm glad I could get through it with a win.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just tried to stay on the back foot and hit a good serve. I didn't have the best return because he was serving really good and he got the timing and everything right. So I couldn't do anything about it. But when I got that ball back, I had a chance to get it back and I missed it a little bit, but I think he played a great shot. And then the next game I broke his serve and got a break back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was a bit tricky at first because I didn't expect him to pull off a shot like that, but I just tried to stay focused and play my game. It ended up working out for me in the end.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, the second set was definitely challenging, but I just tried to stay focused and stick to my game plan. It's all about staying mentally strong in those moments.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was challenging, but I'm really proud of the way I managed to stay strong and just fight through it. I think she definitely stepped it up a little bit. Maybe it's because I was on the defensive, so she took that opportunity to take the serve and stuff. But I just felt like I needed to dig deep and try and fight with her. And I knew that she was going to do whatever she could to win that set. So I felt that I had to put everything into the third.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, it was definitely challenging, especially in the second set. The pressure was immense, and I had to dig deep to find the strength and determination to keep pushing forward.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>What did you not do? I didn't play. I just, you know, I woke up late and I prioritized. Rest a little bit, work with my physio, just, you know, get a little bit of distance and recover for today because I knew it was going to be a battle. So I will not forget to play tennis for a few hours. So it was just a little bit more in recovery.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, on my off days, I usually start with some light stretching to loosen up my muscles. Then, if I have time, a little light cardio like jogging or cycling can help keep me active. I also try to catch up on some reading or watching a movie to relax. It's important to balance rest and recovery, so I make sure to get enough sleep and take care of my body.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I usually focus on staying relaxed and making sure my body is prepared. If I wake up later than usual, I’ll adjust my routine—probably just take it easy with stretching or light movement. I don't like to overdo it if I'm a bit behind schedule, but the goal is always to be prepared for the next match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, obviously I woke up late and I had to go to the doctor for my ankle, which was kind of the reason why I slept in, so I didn't want to wake up early. And yeah, it was fine. I got a lot of stretching and foam rolling and just kind going out and doing some recovery things.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> My off-day routine is pretty simple. I like to start with a light workout, maybe some yoga or stretching to loosen up. Then, I usually have a nutritious meal to fuel my body for the next day. I also enjoy reading books or watching movies to relax and unwind. As for waking up late, it's not a big deal for me. I'm used to it and try to stay focused on my training and recovery.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel pretty exhausted, to be honest. It’s been a long tournament, and every match takes a lot out of me. But I’m staying focused and doing my best to push through. Confidence-wise, I always try to keep a positive mindset, even when I'm tired. I know it’s about pacing myself and being mentally strong for the next challenges.
