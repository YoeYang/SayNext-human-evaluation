              <strong>Answer：</strong> I’m definitely pleased with the wins so far, especially with the tough matches against Del Potro. But there’s still a lot of work ahead, and I’m focusing on giving my best against Nini. I’m enjoying my tennis, but I know it’s important to stay grounded and keep pushing myself.

        <legend>Question 2（ID 121）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It was kind of surprising for me that how in great form she is now. Like she is playing good, you know, and moving well and very solid on the baseline, very aggressive, of course, serving well. And so that's a good job for her. She just also, she wasn't giving me much of a rhythm because she was either making like winners or easy mistakes kind of. And so that was not easy for me.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was the fact that she took a lot of chances, which she did well today. I didn't really feel like I was in control of the point. She came forward a couple of times, and I wasn't able to really get a hold of my shots. And then she came up with some amazing winners.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Honestly, I was really focused on the match and didn't think much about surprising anyone. I just tried to stay in the moment and give it my all.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, there was a particular moment during the match where she executed a backhand slice that completely caught me off guard. It was an unexpected move, considering her usual playstyle.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, no, I mean, I knew that coming into the match, so it wasn't like I started hitting with her and thought about changing my game plan. So it didn't really affect me that much. All I did was, well, I feel like she was hitting more to my backhand than anything. So all I did was try to keep it cross court.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I did notice her forehand was strong, but I tried to stay focused on my own game plan and adjust where I needed to. It’s always about adapting and finding ways to counter strength with my own strategies.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's true, she did have a strong forehand with a big swing. It definitely had an impact on how I played today. I had to adjust my strategy and be more cautious in certain situations to avoid getting caught off guard.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, she does have a big forehand and she hits it really hard. And she, yeah, her backhand is also really good. So she's definitely a good player. But I was just trying to play my game and I think I did a pretty good job.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, her strong forehand and big swing definitely had an impact on my game today. I had to adjust my strategy and focus on anticipating those powerful shots. It was a challenge, but it also motivated me to improve my own technique and be more aggressive in my play.

        <legend>Question 4（ID 226）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's kind of hard to judge what has affected him psychologically tonight because physically he was obviously hurt. And I won most of our matches that we played against each other throughout our careers, but still he's a top-temple player for so many years and very experienced on the big stage. He has won against all of the top players in a big tournament, so he's had that experience. So I knew that if he's fit, he'll battle hard and he'll put in the fight and obviously wanting to win. But it wasn't to be for him and I'm really sorry to see him go through pain. He's had some tough injuries in the last couple of years. I'm sure he's not feeling great about ending the Grand Slam this way, but he has had some marathon matches this tournament that probably have taken the toll on his body. Hmm.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't really think about having an advantage before the match starts. Every match is a new challenge, and I try to focus on my own game and strategy rather than dwelling on external factors like the length of my opponent's previous matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, you always know that it's going to be a very tough match, no matter what you know about him. He's a great player. I know he's been playing some amazing tennis over the last few weeks. So I knew that I was going into something that's not going going be easy. And then I also know him very well. We played a lot of times together. It's always tricky to play a good match against a friend. But I think I played well today and I'm very happy with the way I managed to stay in the match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. I think the mental preparation is just as important as the physical preparation. Knowing that Kay has played many longer matches, it definitely gives me an advantage psychologically. It allows me to anticipate his tactics and to prepare myself mentally for the endurance aspect of the match. So, even before I hit the ball, I feel I have an edge.

I maybe could have done things better, but at the end she deserves to win and that's really it. You had a bit of treatment on your foot early. Is it blisters that you have? Yeah, it's blisters at the end. I think the surface of the court, I don't know how much heat is, but it's terrible. It's very, very hot and it's easy to get blisters and red.</div>

And I think it was a little bit more of a surprise to me, that she was able to play so well, considering she had been injured for quite a while. But, um, no, for me it just, uh, she just played well.

I tried to play really fast from both sides to make him run, but he was on every ball. He used his slice really well. So he played a really good match. He was really solid. He served better, much better than I did. He didn't serve really well today. But it was not easy to finish a point. And I didn't find a way to finish the point or to go to the net.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think he played a bit more aggressive than in the first set, so he was more focused. And also, I didn't put the balls in, which was not the best. I felt like I was a little bit slow. So he took the chance when I missed the ball. He was aggressive, and I couldn't resist.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on his facial expressions and body language, the athlete appears to be in a thoughtful and contemplative state. His eyes are slightly narrowed, and his mouth is set in neutral, indicating he is carefully considering his response. He may take a moment to gather his thoughts before responding. When he speaks, he might mention a particular aspect of the match that stood out, such as teamwork, individual performance, or strategic adjustments that played a significant role in their success.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think she played very well in the second set. She raised her game, and I just couldn't quite match her level today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. It definitely felt like I went to the next level in the second set. I felt a lot more focused and energized.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think she played unbelievable. She literally went for it. I mean, it was unbelievable and I was really impressed. The second set was just incredible. So it's tough to play against that. And I didn't feel like it happened out there. It was more like I felt like, okay, now I'm in the second round and it feels like a different match. But it definitely felt that she went to another level and she was playing unbelievable tennis.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It felt like it happened in slow motion. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like everything slowed down and I had to focus on every single detail of the game. It was an incredible feeling, but also a bit overwhelming.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, my intensity was the same. Throughout the match it was very high. At the beginning she was matching my intensity and then I was just trying to raise my level, trying to go more for my shots. And in the end I was probably stronger with my game because she started a little bit missing here and there. And I think this was the key. Just, you know, I was more patient and yeah, it was more solid.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think it was the difference in the speed. I felt like she was hitting the ball very fast and I was not able to run to the balls as much as I would have liked. And I just felt that my timing was off. So I definitely felt a little bit rushed.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The big difference is likely the level of preparation and confidence. The first step is often about getting started and overcoming initial challenges, while the second step involves refining skills and adjusting to new levels of competition.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The first step was about getting back in the game and finding my rhythm, while the second step was about pushing myself to new limits and improving my performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The primary difference between the first step and the second step lies in the level of intensity and depth of engagement. The first action tends to be more preparatory and focused on initial steps, whereas the subsequent step involves a deeper level, requiring more concentration and physical or mental effort.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That's true. It's important to remember that even the best athletes face setbacks and losses along the way. What matters is how you bounce back from those challenges and use them as motivation to improve and ultimately achieve success.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, it definitely helps to know that athletes like Kim Kleister and Chris Everett lost a few finals first before winning. It shows that even the best have setbacks and that success is often built on learning from those experiences.
