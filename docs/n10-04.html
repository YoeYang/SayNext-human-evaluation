        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>kid-imparent relationship. For years I didn't listen to him. Kind of just went through one ear, not the other, to be honest. It wasn't until I started researching these things for myself and seeing how they affect the way that I feel and my energy and all that that I really started taking this seriously. So I'm actually taking a nutrition course online and it's definitely one of my passions.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> ...just like with any professional sport, there have been ups and downs with maintaining a strict diet. But over the years, I’ve become more aware of how important it is for my performance, and I’ve really tried to make it a central part of my routine. It’s a learning process, but it definitely plays a significant role in my career now.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I've been involved in tennis for a long time and my dad's expertise has definitely influenced my approach to diet. While it's not always been a central focus, I believe it's important to fuel our bodies properly for optimal performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important in all sports, not just tennis, but all of the sports that you're very fit and you have to take care of your body and your diet is a big part of that. And for me, I never really have a strict diet. I eat a lot of carbs, a ton of different things, so I'm not really that particular about what I do, and it doesn't really affect me.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I've played her a couple times already and she's really tough to play. I can barely read her serves so it's very difficult for me. And like I see now that she doesn't hit too many on four stairs, which is a little bit dangerous. But definitely if I play her too, I'm looking forward to it because she also, I've never really seen her get angry and I think that would be a really good match to watch.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, the support of the crowd was great for both me and him. And I want to thank the crowd for staying in very late. You know, we played almost one in the morning. And I do have lots of support, lots of people from the Serbian community to come out to back me up. And it's really nice to see, actually, that people stay. And there's quite a lot of people still until the end of the match, even though it was that late. People love tennis. And of course, we try to perform our best in front of them, for them, and for ourselves as well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "Well, if I had an edge or a boost like that, I would definitely put it towards improving my game, perhaps investing in better training facilities or hiring a coach to help me reach my next level.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I have been growing my hair out for quite some time now, and it definitely has become a topic of discussion among fans and commentators. While it might pose some challenges, especially in terms of aerodynamics and practicality, it is ultimately a personal choice and something that I am comfortable with. As for failures, every athlete experiences them, but it's important to learn from them and keep moving forward. I try to stay focused on my training and performance rather than dwelling on past setbacks.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's body language in the images you've provided, it appears he is feeling either introspective or somewhat pressured. His gaze is downward, and he appears to be focused on his hands, which can indicate deep thought or possibly discomfort. His posture is slightly hunched, with his shoulders pulled forward, suggesting he might be hesitant or trying to gather his thoughts before responding.

Given the context of the question about his game and collaboration with his coach, it's likely that the athlete is taking a moment to reflect carefully before articulating a response. He may want to ensure he provides a thoughtful and meaningful answer.

He will likely say something like:

**"I've been focusing on improving my consistency, especially on my serve and return. Arden and I have been working on making my game more solid overall, focusing on minimizing errors in crucial moments."**

This response would align with his thoughtful demeanor, as he seems to be contemplating the best way to express his efforts and progress.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think in general terms, yeah, just the basics. I mean, I've been working on a lot of things with my coach. It's just that he's in charge of a few things and he has a certain way of doing things. And I just follow his lead, but yeah.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I mean, I think she played great. She was serving really well and she was playing really aggressive, so it was really tough for me to get into the match. But I was just saying, you know, it's a third set. It's not too bad. So just going to refocus. And we had a little time because the roof closed. So I was just trying to take advantage of it, trying to eat a little bit to get some energy. And then, yeah, just going out there and try to fight for every point.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I just got a little frustrated with my performance. I wasn't executing the game plan as well as I should have, and I let the pressure get to me a bit. But I tried to stay focused and refocus for the third set.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> When I lost the second set, I was thinking that I needed to refocus and regain my composure. It was a tough set for me, but I knew that it was important to stay positive and keep pushing forward. I tried to analyze what had gone wrong and make adjustments to my strategy for the remaining sets.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was a little bit too passive on her side. I didn't go to the net as much as I wanted to. And I felt that she was playing very well. So I just tried to push myself more and try to go for more shots.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I think the biggest thing for me is the belief. I think I believe in myself more this year than I have last year. Like in Brisbane, I played the same sort of match like I lost the first set and I managed to win again and it was against the same player. So I think just having that experience.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Um, I think it's just the mentality that I've been trying to develop and the mental toughness that, um, you know, like, yeah, it doesn't matter what the score is or what I'm down by. I just have to keep fighting and keep competing and, uh, and you never give up.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the video, it appears that she is in a thoughtful and reflective state. Her eyes are slightly narrowed, and her mouth is closed, indicating concentration and introspection. Given this body and facial language, I predict that her next response to the reporter's question might involve discussing the strategies or mental approaches that have helped her overcome the deficit. She might mention aspects like improved focus, better mental resilience, or enhanced game plans that enable her to bounce back from losing the first set.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's just about being able to stay focused and not let that first set affect the rest of the match. It's important to remember that every point is new and you can always come back from a deficit.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it’s really about learning from experiences and staying patient. I’ve been working on my mental toughness, focusing on staying in the moment and believing in my ability to fight back. It’s something I’ve grown into over time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your observation, but it's crucial to remember that sportsmanship and mental resilience are key aspects of any athletic endeavor. During the second set, I was concentrating on my game strategy and pushing through the fatigue, which is part of the experience. I'm confident that I can manage and overcome any challenges that arise during future matches.
