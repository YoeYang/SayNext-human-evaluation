              <strong>Answer：</strong> The atmosphere created by the Greek fans was truly incredible today. It was electrifying to see so many passionate supporters, and it definitely added to the intensity of the match. I feel incredibly grateful for their support and energy. As for the on-field advantage against Federer, it's always challenging to predict, but having such a supportive crowd behind me definitely gives me a boost of confidence. We'll see how it plays out in the upcoming matches.

As for Federer, he's an incredible player, and it will be a tough match, no matter the atmosphere. I can't rely on any perceived advantage but will focus on my game and preparation."**

This response reflects a balance of gratitude towards the fans, while maintaining humility and respect for his upcoming opponent.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. I appreciate the concern about my performance. However, I want to clarify that I was discussing my training and preparation strategies with my coach. It's essential to maintain focus and discipline in our sport. While it may seem like I'm talking to my "box," that's just a term used to describe the mental strategies and visualization techniques that help me stay focused during competitions. The term "air conditioning" is metaphorical, representing the adjustments and fine-tuning of these techniques to ensure optimal performance.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was really important. I mean, there was a great group of guys playing there and a very high level. So to be able to finish off how I did, I was very close to finishing with a win, but still extremely proud of my efforts. And one of the main things I wanted to do in 2018 was to back up my level week after week. And I thought I did that tremendously well and to be able to come back in the last tournament of the year where you're not feeling your best, you're tired, body's a bit fatigued, and to come out and play some good tennis and just come short in the final. I was very happy with myself and obviously gave me a lot of confidence coming into 2019.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Last year in Milan was a truly remarkable experience for me. Playing in the next gen tournament was incredibly different from anything I've done before. The level of competition and the intensity of the matches were both new and challenging. It was an opportunity to learn and grow, to adapt to different playing styles, and to develop new strategies. Overall, it was invaluable in my career and I gained a lot from that experience.

I learned a lot from that experience, and it helped me grow as a player. It was a different format, but it was still an exciting opportunity to compete against some of the best players in the world.

I've played a lot of juniors last year and this was a great opportunity for me to play a couple of matches against some really good players and just really get a feel for how I can compete against these guys and also get used to the atmosphere of a packed arena.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It was what it needed to be. It's obviously tough to have necessarily a solid performance all the way through, but I did what I needed to. I took care of my serve. I broke quite early in all the sets, just dropped off a little bit where I faced a few sort of dangers on my service games in the beginning of the third and end of the second.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I improved everything. I'm more aggressive than before, I can play good tennis in every situation and I feel good on court. So I don't know, for me I am just happy that I play this good.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know, you know, I think you always at certain points, especially when you start having injuries and stuff, you start maybe doubting if you're ever going to be, you know, 100 percent healthy for longer periods of time. But, you know, I think last year and already for a year and a half, I've proved that, you know, I can beat anyone out there on court. And, you know, when you're in the final sit-down, I'm not going to lie, I was really nervous before going out there on court. But once I kind of settled in and we had to warm up, I was just like, I have everything to win and at the end of the day, you know, whatever happens happens and I'm going to go out fighting. And if it's not enough today, then it is what it is, but I'm going to be proud of my effort.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> You're right. There were definitely moments where I missed my opportunities, but those are the moments that make me want to work even harder. I'm determined to improve and make the most of my next chances.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of a tough match to play. I think I was playing really well. The whole week, my opponent was really strong. And, yeah, there was a couple of games that I wasn't able to finish. But, you know, she fought back really, really hard. She was just, just fighting for every point. So, and, uh, at the end of the day, the last two games, um, they just went her way.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a prediction of the athlete's next response based on their facial expressions and body language. The video does not show the reporter's question or the athlete's immediate reaction to it. To accurately predict the athlete's response, I would need additional context or a subsequent frame showing her reaction after hearing the question.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think all the parts of my game were pretty solid. I mean, I had some unforced errors, which I would have liked to go for less, but I'm happy that I was able to really fight through those points and get the job done.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> If I had to narrow it down to 9%, the part of my game that would let me down is my serve. I've been struggling with consistency and power on my serves lately, which has affected my overall performance in matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was tough out there. Playing someone like Serena, I knew I had to step up, but I also felt like there were moments where I was overthinking. It’s a learning experience, and I felt like I learned a lot about my game today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was feeling pretty good out there. It was a great match, and I felt like I held my own against someone like Serena. I think we both played well, but I'm definitely learning and growing from matches like these.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was good for me to play against her. I was a little bit surprised that I'm going to be playing her in the third round. But I know her very well. We played twice before, so I knew that it's going very tough match. And it can go both ways, but I played good.
