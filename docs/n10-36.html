              <strong>Answer：</strong> “Well, I don’t think there’s any harm. It was just a misunderstanding, and I spoke with the team afterward. I apologized for the spray, and we moved on. Everyone’s fine now.” 

This response reflects her calm approach and ability to handle the situation with grace, staying positive and composed.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was definitely something I haven't experienced before. There's definitely been a lot of firsts for me over the last few weeks. Yeah, there was kind of a lot going on, a lot of media and my phone was going crazy. I just had so much support from so many people and I just tried to stay as focused and as grounded as possible. I spent a heap of time with my family and yeah, I just tried to treat it as kind of as normal of a tournament as I could and I had doubles the next day so I kind of just tried to enjoy it as much as I could for a couple of hours after the match and then refocus. It was just a totally new experience and hopefully one that I'll get the chance to have again and I think each time I keep putting myself in that position I'll get better at handling situations like that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was a pretty incredible moment, honestly. I mean, the crowd was amazing, and I was definitely overwhelmed with joy at first. But after that, I took some time to relax and refocus. It’s important to take the emotions of the win in, but then reset and think about the next step. It’s all part of the journey.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The experience of coming down after the Vekic match two days ago was incredibly overwhelming. It was definitely a highlight of my career so far. The crowd's reaction was amazing, and it was such a rush to see all of those people cheering for me. I remember feeling a mix of emotions – joy, relief, disbelief, but also a bit of exhaustion from the intensity of the match and the subsequent celebrations. Refocusing for tonight was challenging, as there was so much to process, both mentally and emotionally. However, I'm glad I was able to gather myself and approach this match with a clear head. Overall, it's an experience I'll never forget, filled with highs and lows that have shaped me as an athlete.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was an incredible experience, coming down after the Vekic match. The energy of the crowd was overwhelming, and I felt a mix of emotions - elation, relief, and a sense of accomplishment. It was definitely the biggest win of my career so far, and it's hard to put into words how it felt. In terms of refocusing for tonight's match, it wasn't easy, but I've been through tough moments before and have learned to stay focused. The emotions in the days following that match were intense, but I'm ready to give it my all tonight.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I was feeling good. I mean, of course, it's hot out there, but I was expecting this year in Melbourne, like every single year. And I think it was good that I played in Perth, completely different conditions than the night matches in Sydney. Now I played here during the day, so now I think I'm ready for, for, doesn't matter what time I will play. So no, but I was, I was feeling good. So even it was really hot. My body was feeling quite good. And I'm happy that I played like a little bit more than one hour today.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it’s been quite a transition with the different conditions. I’ve been doing my best to prepare for the heat here, but it's definitely a challenge. The pre-season in Germany and the Hotman Cup were all quite different environments. I think it’s about adjusting and managing the heat as best I can, but I’m confident that with the right strategies, I’ll be able to handle it better as the tournament progresses.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, the first days here I felt a little bit tired because the days before I had a lot of indoor work and I was practicing in Germany in the indoor court. So it was a bit difficult for me to wake up early because I'm used to sleeping a couple of hours later. But the last two days I have been practicing outside. I played night matches in Sydney so I got used of it. And yeah, it's a good sign.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've definitely been training in various conditions, both indoor and outdoor, to prepare for the diverse temperatures we might encounter here. While it's been challenging, I feel that my body has adapted well and I'm confident in my ability to handle the heat.

        <legend>Question 4（ID 82）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>To be honest, the way she was playing the match, it was like there was, you know, I was just going to have to play defense and try to play offense whenever I had an opportunity. So I want to dictate, but the way she was playing was just almost impossible to do so. So it was just about trying to control the point in whichever way that was, if that meant that defensively I control the point or I was able to get a little offense, whatever it was, I mean, just be the one winning the point at the end somehow.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> After the first set, I felt like I needed to change my approach. I realized that I was too focused on just hitting big shots and wasn't being as aggressive as I could have been. So, I decided to mix things up a bit more and try to be more unpredictable with my shots. I also worked on my footwork and tried to move the ball around more effectively. It paid off in the second set, and I was able to take control of the game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand what you're asking, and yes, after the first set, I did make some adjustments to my game. I wanted to maintain my focus and make sure I was playing to the best of my abilities. It's all about finding the right balance and adjusting my strategy on-the-fly to stay competitive.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just tried to stay focused and make a few tactical adjustments. I aimed to stay aggressive and pressure her serve, knowing I needed to step up my game in the second set. Ultimately, it was about staying positive and finding ways to turn things around.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I just kind of knew that she was going to try to do a lot of different things than the first set and I was just like, okay, just go for it and hit some more winners and be aggressive and yeah, that was it.

This time, I feel more prepared and confident, especially after the progress I made in the previous tournaments. The experience from the first semi-final has given me a better understanding of the tournament's dynamics, and I'm looking forward to giving it my best shot.

I feel like I'm making improvements, but in the last couple of years, I just feel like I've just haven't been physically ready to play these long matches and back it up. I did a really good off-season this year. I trained with Leighton and the guys in Melbourne for two weeks. I feel physically, I feel really good. Just give me confidence in my game. I know that, mentally, I'm a lot better as well. Obviously, getting a good start in Brisbane helped.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important to be adaptable and to quickly assess the situation when things aren't going as planned. It's about being able to pivot and make adjustments to get back on track. This skill is crucial not just in sports, but in all aspects of life.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I don’t think my break has affected my game too much. I’m still working on getting back to my top form, and it’s a process. Progress takes time, and I’m confident I’ll get there.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I understand that my progress has been less than ideal. The break has undoubtedly had an impact on my game, but I am working diligently to regain my form. My focus is on improving and bouncing back stronger than ever.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I appreciate your concern, but I'm feeling much better now. The break has given me the opportunity to rest and recharge, which is crucial for my performance. I'm focusing on my game and making adjustments as needed. I'm confident that I'll be back to my best soon.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel like I'm definitely getting there. I just have to play a few more matches to get there, but I definitely feel that I've been improving. How do you feel about the level you're at right now? I don't know. It's definitely good. You're playing good players and it's always good to have that opportunity to put those things in place.

        <legend>Question 8（ID 230）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think Roger in the second set was a lucky, I was following the right life score. So a lot of break points in key moments. Probably if he takes one of them, one of that break points, probably there will be a big difference on that score. But surprising or not, I will not say no, because always when Federer is on court, he's always surprised when he loses. But we know that they are good. We know that Stefano is one of the players that can win against everybody. So it was a surprise, but not a very big surprise. I know Stefano is ready to win against everybody.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, yes, maybe a little bit surprising, but at the same time, he is a great player, and he showed that he deserves the win. You know, in sport, anything can happen, and today was his day.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was not a surprise, but it was a great comeback. He played well in the first set, and he started the match with the right intensity. And then he had to change a little bit the pace of the game in his service games, because he was playing too aggressive in that first part of that set. So he changed a few things in those service sets, he became more consistent with his returns, became less aggressive with that serve, started to play more and more from the baseline. Then I was able to take advantage of his mistakes, of course. I went to the tie-break, I had chances to go up 5-3 in both sets. But in general terms, it's true that he played very well, very focused, with a lot of intensity, which is always a plus.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, it was definitely a surprise to come back and find out that I won. I hadn't expected it, so it felt quite overwhelming and exciting at the same time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I played her once, I think in Birmingham. And it was a good match, but very, very difficult to play against her because she plays the ball so big, so strong. She's a player that really tries to destroy you with her shots. So I know I have to be ready for that. I need to work on defense, on my side. You know, trying to create some chances. It's going to...

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've faced Serena in a few tournaments, but not at a Grand Slam. It's a tough match regardless, and I'll need to bring my A-game to compete with her. I'm focused on preparing well for each round and taking it one match at time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> To make the match more competitive in the second set, the athlete needs to maintain a high level of focus and intensity. This involves sustaining energy, staying mentally engaged, and continuously adapting strategies to keep the opponent guessing.

However, I can still interpret images and help analyze a still image to predict emotions or reactions.
