        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I always have doubts. I say it 100 times. And I believe that the doubts are good because the doubts... when you have doubts it's because you are not too arrogant, it's because you have respect for your opponent, it's because you have respect for the game, and it's because you don't consider yourself unbelievable good. So the real thing is I always have doubts, but at the same time I have the confidence that I was ready to start the tournament. And that was the case. I am through to the second round, that's the positive thing for me and I am looking forward to play the next match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems you're asking me to predict the athlete's response based on their body language and facial expression in the given image. Unfortunately, I can't view the images directly in this setup. However, I can help guide you in interpreting these factors.

For a more accurate prediction, I would focus on the following:
- **Facial Expression**: Look for signs of confidence, hesitation, or contemplation in their facial expression. Raised eyebrows, tight lips, or looking down could suggest uncertainty.
- **Body Language**: How relaxed or tense is their posture? A slouched posture could suggest fatigue or doubt, while an upright and open posture could indicate confidence.

Would you like to describe the athlete's expression and body language, and I can help you further analyze it?

I think I had a good preparation here with all the matches, the conditions I think are nearly the same. So I think not doing too much but just playing on the chords before I play one match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not sure I entirely understand the question, but I think you're asking about my training schedule and how I balance it with rest. It's always a challenge, but I try to make the most of my time to recover.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I understand your interest in my training schedule and the upcoming events. Rest and training are crucial parts of my preparation. After receiving my money on Monday, I will have a few days to rest before the next training session. This period is essential for me to regain my strength and focus. As for God getting used to me, it's a matter of discipline and perseverance. It's all about maintaining a routine and staying dedicated to my goals. Thank you again for your inquiry.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, you sort of tried to take things as they come. You know that he's going to make a push. He's going to try to do things a little bit differently in that third set. And I think I handle it well. There weren't really any opportunities either way until that 4-5 game. And then I had one legitimate opportunity. Maybe I would have liked to have done things differently if things didn't work out. But overall, I'm happy with how I dealt with numerous situations throughout the match and how I played. I think I did some things extremely well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely tough. After those first two sets, I tried to stay focused because I knew he would push back. You have to expect a player of his caliber to not go down easily, so the challenge was to stay mentally strong and keep fighting.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it's hard. I was expecting him to start playing much better, but he didn't. And I didn' start well, too. But still, I mean, the match was not easy, especially the second set. It was almost a must-win for him. So it was a close one.

        <legend>Question 4（ID 324）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, I know that she played well at the end of the year. She won the WTA finals. And personally, I was really happy for her because I know that everyone was sort of writing her off because she wasn't doing well leading up to that. And I know that she's playing well again here because I'm going to play her and she's still here. So definitely, I've played her multiple times now and I know that she's a very consistent player. And when she has the chance, she does like to attack. So I think playing her is going to be very difficult for me. And like comparing her to other players, I can't really do that because Sevastova, she slices a lot. I don't think Sivit Duena slices as much as her. And Sue Wei, is that the correct pronunciation? Sue Wei is completely different from anyone I've ever played, so it's kind of impossible to compare them.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think she's been playing really well. She's like, we play each other a couple times in the past, so I know she can play really, really good. And yeah, she likes to play, like aggressive and play a lot of winners. So she, yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> In the quarterfinals, I've noticed a significant improvement in her game over the last four months. Her confidence has grown, and she's been playing with more aggression and precision. The particular challenges have been adapting to her new playing style and dealing with the physical demands of the sport. Compared to playing Sevastiva and Shea, it's different in that she brings a unique set of skills and strengths to the table, requiring me to adjust my strategies accordingly. Overall, she has been a tough opponent and a valuable player on the team.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I've been playing really well in the last few months. I've been working hard and focusing on my game, and it's paying off. It's been a challenge to play against Sevastova and Strydom, but they're both great players and I respect them. I'm just trying to stay focused and keep pushing myself to be the best that I can be.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think she's been playing really well, especially over the last few months. She's very consistent, and her style of play presents unique challenges. Comparing her to Sevastova and Hsieh, they each have their strengths, but the way she executes her game is quite distinct. I’ll definitely need to prepare accordingly for her.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's always sad to lose, especially in the fourth round of a Grand Slam. It hurts. I was two points away from winning this match. But on the other hand, I think she played extremely well in those moments. From 5-2, half-30, I think she really played like... She didn't miss a ball and I cannot say I did something wrong. So from that side, I let it all out there and I'm proud of myself for this match and for the whole tournament. So I just want to take the positives out of it.</div>

This would align with the somber tone conveyed in her body language, where she doesn't appear overly distraught but rather reflective.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was definitely the conditions. I struggled to find my rhythm and serve, and it affected my overall performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, the conditions definitely seemed to be a challenge. It was tough to get into a rhythm, and I think the wind was playing a significant role in the way the ball was behaving. Additionally, I might have been a bit too hard on myself, which didn't help in finding my game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm very disappointed that I wasn't able to win today. I think I had a lot of chances, especially in the second set. And I just felt like I was playing a bit too passive and not moving my feet enough and just going for it. So I definitely felt that, but yeah, it was frustrating to lose.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I was a bit frustrated out there. It wasn’t just the conditions, though they were challenging at times. I think I just couldn’t find my rhythm and that got to me for a while. I need to work on staying more composed in those moments.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's not in my mind. I finished 2 years number 1 so the ranking doesn't matter anymore. I play tennis because I like it and now my challenge is to win every match I play. I know it's probably impossible but I'm trying just to stay with this thought and giving my best so ranking is not in my mind right now.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, it's definitely a lot to think about, but I try to take things one match at a time. The pressure is there, yes, but I don’t let it control me. I focus on my game, my strategy, and just trust in my training. I know there’s always going to be challenges, but I’ve been through tough draws before and I can handle it. It’s just about staying present and doing my best every time I step on the court.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Fighting through this draw has been both challenging and rewarding. It's definitely added pressure knowing that there are so many talented players vying for the number one ranking, but I try to stay focused on my game and not let that pressure interfere with my performance. I believe in my abilities and the work I've put in, so I'm confident in handling the pressure and giving it my all in each match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't feel any pressure. I just want to play my game and I want the win. So I think that's the most important thing and it's not the ranking. It's about winning the match. How do you keep that out of your mind? I'm not thinking about the rankings. When I have the chance to do that, I try to be in the zone and to just play.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's definitely a lot of pressure, but I try to focus on one match at a time. I know there are many talented players in this tournament, and I'm just trying to do my best. I don't really think about the rankings or who else is playing. I just try to stay focused on the present moment and give it my all in each match.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know, just when she was walking towards the net, I could tell that she was quite upset. And I kind of liked that.

You know, I think I really, she's such a good talent. So it's good to see that attitude.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was just telling her to just relax and calm down and that she was really upset. She was crying. I don't know. It's a part of the game. Sometimes things don’t go your way. You just have to deal with it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I don't want to go into too much detail, but I could see she was really emotional after the match. I wanted to make sure she was okay, and at that moment, I just felt it was important to support her. It's always tough in those situations, but I didn't mean to upset her. I think it was more about just checking in on her well-being." 

The athlete appears visibly somber and introspective in the photos provided, possibly suggesting that they might offer a response focused on sensitivity and emotional support.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, when she came over to the net, she seemed really frustrated and upset. She was shouting at me, saying that I had played a bad shot. I tried to calm her down and explain that it was just the heat of the moment, but she was really angry. It was difficult for me to keep my composure and not let her affect my game. Overall, I think she just wanted to vent her frustration and get it off her chest.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Of course, you can't expect easy matches when you play in big tournaments and against good players. It was a tough match in general terms. I missed opportunities in the second that was the truth. You lost three times, break up in the second, then you lose that many chances, then you are in trouble. But of course, he played well and he played aggressive. He did a lot of things well and I didn't play as aggressive as I did last couple of days. That's why I was suffering more. Conditions out there were not easy this afternoon, very humid. It was a tough match, but very happy to be through, of course.</div>
