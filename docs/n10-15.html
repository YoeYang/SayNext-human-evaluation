I'm just happy to stay on the court like big stadium like Marybeth and really good fans. So I'm just happy to be there. Do you know anything about Sandgren? Yeah, he's a really good player. He made like I think he made first quarter final same like me. So I'm just ready for him and I have to good recovery first.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's always tough to refocus after a big win, but we need to stay focused on the next game. We can't let our guard down now.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's very easy because I'm playing Novak so I know I have to be 100% and I can't do anything wrong. So I just try to do my best and just I was I played a good match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Definitely. After such a significant victory, it's crucial to maintain focus and not let the euphoria cloud our judgment. However, I find that taking the time to reflect on the game, identify areas for improvement, and setting clear goals helps me refocus and approach the next game with renewed energy and determination.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> *"Yeah, it’s always a challenge to stay focused after such a big win, but I know I have to keep my eyes on the next match. Every game is important, and I can’t let myself get too caught up in the past. It’s all about maintaining that momentum and staying disciplined."*

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I didn't hear about it, so I'm very happy that the prize money is all over the place, to be quite honest. When I fought for equal prize money for the men's game, I knew it was a dollar for a dollar, also for the women's game going up, and I was really, really happy for them. They deserve it, and they also deserve it on the other tour, because on the WTA tour you're like, I know they're lagging a little bit, so that would be nice to see it going up. But if we can help, great, because sometimes maybe the men's game is more popular, sometimes the women's game, so I think we should always help each other as players, regardless of who is more popular at the moment.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's very important for all of us to help out all the players, men and women. And it would be great to see the women's president, the men's players president come together and try to figure out what can be done better for the benefit of the game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I believe that it is crucial for all players, regardless of gender, to work together to advocate for equal pay across the board. The issue of pay equality extends beyond just the tennis community and has far-reaching implications for other sports and industries as well. While individual players like Serena Williams are raising important points, it's also vital for the players to unite and collectively address this issue. We should strive for a world where all athletes, male and female, are compensated fairly for their efforts and achievements.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important for all players, regardless of gender, to be advocating for fair pay and equal opportunities. It's not just about the women's tour, but about creating a level playing field for everyone in tennis.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems like you've uploaded an image rather than a video. If you'd like to predict an athlete's response based on their facial expressions and body language, I'd need a video or at least more information about their body language and expressions. Feel free to share any details about the athlete’s posture, facial expressions, or general demeanor, and I can give a more informed prediction based on that!

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Great, good news and especially winning against difficult players. Moonfields were the finals, Veref, Santos 16 and now Raunich, I think all of them are top players. That's very important for me because that means that I'm competitive and playing well. I'm excited about being back in the final rounds of the most important events. I am here to try to make this, then it's always difficult, but I fight it and I work hard to try to make that happen. So I'm very happy that after a lot of work being in this round again is a special thing for me and especially here in Australia.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the facial expressions and body language observed in the video, the athlete appears to be thoughtful and focused, indicating a deep engagement with the topic. Given this context, it is likely that the response will be well-thought-out and insightful, possibly touching upon the importance of supporting smaller-scale farming communities and the broader implications of agriculture.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel that this is a great achievement for me. I'm happy. It's not easy to be in semifinals of Grand Slam, especially if you didn't play the best season or you're injured or not at your best level. So I take it as a positive thing. That's the most important. And then we will see. My next round is going to play against Rafa. He's a legend of our sport, probably the greatest player ever. The greatest champion ever, and he's also playing well. We've played each other many times, so we know each the other. Let's see what's going on.

        <legend>Question 5（ID 157）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, because of a practice with him for a few days in a row in Switzerland that helped, knowing that his strength and weaknesses a little bit, he was not completely the unknown opponent that maybe people thought he was. Because in practice I also played a best of five set practice match against him in Switzerland. So when you play multiple sets in a short period of time against somebody, you start to understand their strength and weaknesses a little bit. But then again, it's been a while ago, I didn't see his matches, I haven't watched him much play on TV, so I started forgetting a little bit and how he played exactly. The goal for me was really trying to be focused on my own game and take it to him and play tough, but he hung with me for a long time, so it was a good match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, first of all, I was surprised to see that he's a left-handed player, because he plays really big forehand, very aggressive, and that's not common for a player that hits with both hands. So I played against a lot of left-handers in the past, but never against one-handed players. And then, as I said, today I saw that his serve is very good, he is aggressive from the baseline, so I knew that I need to be ready for this match, be aggressive myself, try to play more aggressive than him, trying to go to the net more, which I did. It was a good decision, in my opinion, to take the serve and play shorter points, more close to him than from 30 meters. But even in that case, it's very difficult to face a guy that serves well, that is so aggressive.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think being happy and content off the court definitely has a positive impact on my performance. When I'm relaxed and feeling good, it allows me to focus better during matches and approach each game with a clear mind. It's important to maintain a balance between my personal life and my athletic career.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Off-course happiness definitely has a significant impact on my performance and approach. It helps me maintain a balanced mindset, and it's essential to have a positive outlook even outside of the court. This balance allows me to perform better and stay focused on what's happening during matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a big part of it. I'm really enjoying myself off the court. My boyfriend is here. He's with me all the time. And I have a good group of friends and family that come to watch me play. So it gives me confidence when I step on the tennis court that everything's going to be all right.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it's getting there. I think it's still early in the tournament, different conditions today. I just had to come out and just play my game. Just imposed that. I didn't know. I never played against the opponent, so in a way I didn't know what to expect, but I just had to be focused. You already had three matches under his belt, so I think it's a good start today.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. It's always a great feeling to be here and compete at such a high level. My first-round performance was solid, but there are always areas to improve on. As for my form in the last couple of months, I've been working hard to stay consistent and focused. I'm feeling good about my game and ready for the rest of the tournament.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the congratulations. In the first round, I felt pretty confident and in control.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>For sure it's not easy if you play less tournaments, but she has enough experience to handle every moment of the matches. So I don't believe she's vulnerable because of that. I didn't play against her since she came back, so I don't know what to say about this, but she's a very tough opponent every time.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important to recognize that returning to the circuit after such a significant period away, especially during pregnancy, can be challenging for any athlete. Serenity's layoff has undoubtedly affected her physically and mentally. However, her dedication and hard work off the court are commendable. I believe she's doing her best to adapt and get back into the competitive mindset. It's not about being'more beatable,' but rather about finding the right balance and regaining her form. As for her playing full time compared to other athletes, it’s about managing her energy and focusing on peak performance when she’ s on court. Everyone has their unique challenges and strengths, so it wouldn’t be fair to say she has no advantage. We'll just have to see how she performs as she continues to come back and re-establish herself in this competitive environment.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important to remember that every player is different, and Serena is a very experienced and skilled athlete. While it's true that she hasn't played as much since her pregnancy, I believe she has the ability to adapt and perform well on the court. As for me, I'm focused on my own game and don't really compare myself to other players. I'm just happy to be here and participate in the sport I love.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't want to speculate too much about Serena's situation. Every player has their own journey and challenges. I can only focus on my game, and I respect Serena's ability and her legacy. As for the idea of vulnerability, every player can face tough moments. But it's not for me to say if she's more beatable now—I'm focused on my own growth and performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know, I think it's difficult to say, because you never know what the opponent is going to do, but I feel like I'm playing well. I've had a really good pre-season and I have nothing to lose out there. So I just try to go out and enjoy myself.
