        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, after 5-2 I think he stepped up a little more. He was more attacking my ball and playing very solid. But I tried to stay focused. Still I had a two breaks up. And I was serving really well today. So I just played with my confidence and it was fine.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was able to stay calm and focused because I knew that I had the advantage in the match. I was able to maintain my composure and not let his run of games affect me. I also knew that I had to stay patient and wait for the right moment to strike back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I was feeling a little bit like a tight moment. And I took a few deep breaths and I just tried to relax myself. I actually went to the toilet to wash my face and then I came back. So I think it was good for me to calm down.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I would like to see some change to the format of Fed Cup. Personally, I think I like the format, but it's also exciting to see some different things. What is that change? I don't know. I don't know what that means and what it would be. But yeah, we definitely want to keep because Fed Cup is such a great thing to play for the country and to play other people and to just to go out there. It's one of the few times we have to be a team, you know, and it's fun. It's actually really fun. So it would be nice, but I don't know what that change is and I don't know what it would look like. But it's something definitely to talk about and to start discussing to see if it's even plausible and go from there. Did the match seem to turn there?</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for bringing up this important issue. I fully understand and share the concerns expressed by Lindsay Davenport and Martina Navratilova. Gender equity in sports is a crucial matter, and it's disheartening to see that women's tennis has not received the same level of attention as men's tennis. As an advocate for gender equality, I believe it's essential to continue pushing for equal opportunities and recognition for female athletes. The FedCAP and Davis Cup should strive to provide equal support and resources to both male and female players. It's our collective responsibility to ensure that women's tennis receives the attention and respect it deserves.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for bringing that up. I completely agree with Lindsay Davenport and Martina Navratilova's concerns. Gender equity is crucial, not just in sports but in all aspects of life. It's disappointing that the FedCAP has not received the same attention as the Davis Cup, and I hope this changes soon. We need to ensure that both men's and women's events receive equal support and recognition. As a strong advocate for gender equity, I will continue to push for fair treatment and opportunities for all athletes, regardless of gender.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think it's great that the players are speaking out and really making their opinions heard because it does need to happen. It's a long overdue change. I mean, there's obviously, you know, the men and women are separate, but there is a lot of things that we can do together and I definitely think that that's one of the things.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for bringing that up. It's an important topic, and as I've always said, equality in sports is crucial. The lack of attention given to the Fed Cup compared to the Davis Cup is a concern. Women in sports deserve the same recognition and opportunities as their male counterparts. It’s time for us to push for change, and to continue advocating for equal treatment and respect for female athletes. We’ve come a long way, but there’s still work to be done.

I've been seeing him all the time. And, you know, the conditions were a little bit slower than I would have liked, but he served really big, really efficient.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's always disappointing when things don't go as planned, but I'm focusing on the positives and learning from this experience. It's an opportunity to grow and improve for the next match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I agree, it was a tough match against Francis today. I'm disappointed I wasn't able to get past him, but I need to refocus and work on my game for the upcoming matches. Thanks for your question.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I'm definitely losing myself so many times. I was up a break in the first and lost myself twice, which cannot happen. And in the third as well, I lost twice. So maybe three times, I don't know. Yeah, so this cannot happen. I mean, even she was playing really, really well, hitting the ball really fast, just stepping up to the court and just going full power into every myself. I just cannot lose myself so many times.</div>

"Yeah, it's tough. Honestly, I just felt like I couldn't find my rhythm today. I was trying, but the more I pushed, the more mistakes piled up. It's hard to pinpoint one thing, but I just couldn't turn it around after a certain point."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The most upsetting thing for me today was not performing at my best when I had been working so hard. It was really disappointing, especially because I wanted to do well and show everyone that I can handle the pressure.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was her second serve, but I don't think I was really solid on the return side, like I wasn't putting the ball in. So I didn't really have a chance to get back into the match. And I felt like my level was just not there today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That's true. Everyone has their own set of challenges and strengths. It's part of what makes us unique. I think what's important is to focus on your own journey and not compare it to others.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's not the first time it's happening. It happened in the US Open last year. And it happened again in Sydney a few weeks ago. So, you know, I just try to be ready for it and accept that this is going to happen.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was ready last year, I just didn't win the match. But I did a lot of things well. I fought, it was a close match, so I don't regret about it. And today, of course, when you lose in the second round, you're not happy, but still, the first matches are always difficult after a long time without playing. So I'm happy to be back on the tour, and I hope I can win next time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I think I wasn't fully prepared, to be honest. There were some things I needed to work on after the French Open, and today, I felt like I wasn’t completely ready to perform at my best. But I'm working on it and will come back stronger." 

This response would align with a contemplative, somewhat vulnerable, yet determined attitude.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I feel much more prepared today. Last year, the situation was quite different, and I was still adjusting to many new aspects. However, this year I've had more time to mentally prepare and strategize. I'm confident in my abilities and am excited to see how things unfold.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm feeling good today. I've been preparing well for the match, and I'm confident in my abilities. I learned a lot from last year's experience at the French Open, and I'm using that knowledge to improve my game. I'm ready to give it my all on the court.
