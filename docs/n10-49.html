        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, that's why I'm hiring a hair hairdresser the next week. That's why I wear headbands. Otherwise, I would be in huge trouble during a match. I like it. It's my trademark. It's my signature. I'm gonna keep it. I'll tell you that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I have been growing my hair out for quite some time now, and it definitely has become a topic of discussion among fans and commentators. While it might pose some challenges, especially in terms of aerodynamics and practicality, it is ultimately a personal choice and something that I am comfortable with. As for failures, every athlete experiences them, but it's important to learn from them and keep moving forward. I try to stay focused on my training and performance rather than dwelling on past setbacks.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I think that's what I've always been trying to prove, is that my hair doesn't bother me. And I'm not sure if you ask any other tennis player, they're all gonna say that their hair is bothering them. But yeah, you know, for me, it's more of a personal preference. I just like to have it that way.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't think my long hair causes any problems. Honestly, I don't think about it much during matches. As for failure, it's part of the sport, but I try to focus on learning and moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's true that my long hair has caused some challenges, especially during matches. It can get in the way and sometimes gets tangled, but I've learned to manage it. I always try to stay focused on the game and not let any distractions affect my performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I am glad that five-set tiebreakers have been introduced in Australia. It adds an exciting element to the matches and keeps the games more engaging for both players and fans.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I'm glad they've been introduced. It makes the match a bit fairer and less exhausting, especially when it gets tight in the fifth set. It's good for the players and probably more exciting for the fans as well.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's a good thing. And I'm just, yeah, like I said, it was a little bit long. But I don't mind, because I felt like it gave me more time to focus on the match. So it wasn't like, you know, a countdown or anything like that. It was just like a normal match, so that's the best thing for me.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Of course it's very tough, not easy mentally, but from the moment on I was a break up in the third set. The mind was again positive and also in the first two sets it was close sets. I think I had my chances in both sets so I always knew that if I play well and if I keep it up that I could turn it around.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was thinking I have to keep fighting and try to do the best I can and see how far I could go. I don't think about the score. It's a long time, long rally. The Australian heat is a lot different to other Grand Slams, so I think it's not easy to play against someone when you're two sets of love. But I had some chances in the third set, but I couldn't really close it. So I'm very happy to be in semis.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> When I was down two sets and facing such a hot environment, my primary thought was to stay focused and not let the conditions get the best of me. I knew that every point mattered and maintaining composure was crucial. The big uphill battle was daunting, but I kept pushing myself to keep fighting and finding ways to come back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was thinking about my training and how I've prepared for this moment. I knew it would be tough, but I also knew I had the mental strength to push through.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, at that point, I was just trying to stay focused and take it one point at a time. I knew it was going to be tough given the conditions, but I reminded myself to stay mentally strong and not think too far ahead. I trusted my preparation and believed I could find a way to fight back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, obviously my parents were very much into sports. My dad played a lot of tennis and a little bit of basketball and my mum played tennis as well. So I was obviously brought up playing a bunch of different sports and I started playing tennis when I think I'm about four. I don't know, four or five. And then I just loved it.

So I'm pleased with the way I started the match, right away again, got off a great start against him, like I did against him a few years ago, and after that, naturally everything's easier. And the second set was definitely a key to shut it down for him. It was good that I was able to break back after he played a good game there. And then in the third set, I think I was rolling, so it was a nice match. I think I played great. I misshad a wonderful tournament, so well done to him.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a good match, but obviously not as I wanted. It's a Grand Slam semifinal, you want to win in two sets, not one, and it's never easy against Stan. He's fighting till the last point, he's playing great tennis, playing well in Grand slams, so it was not easy. And yeah, I thought I did a lot of things well, except maybe the second set on his serve, which I didn't read the serve particularly well. I think he served very well that game. That's one thing I could have improved. But yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I feel like my ball striking has been good so far. On both the practice court and the match court, I've been able to maintain consistency and control, which has been key. I've been focusing on staying relaxed and getting into a rhythm early in my matches. Of course, there are always areas to improve, but overall, I’m happy with how it’s going." 

Her facial expressions and body language indicate that she is feeling confident but also reflective, considering both the positive aspects and areas for growth. The slight tilt of her head and the occasional smile hint at a composed but thoughtful response.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I feel like my performance has been consistent across both the practice court and the match court. I've been focusing on my technique and building my confidence, which has helped me to maintain a steady level of performance in both settings. The practice sessions have allowed me the opportunity to fine-tune my shots, while the matches have given me valuable experience in applying those skills under pressure. Overall, I'm pleased with my progress and am looking forward to continuing to improve.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yes, it's not a problem. For me it's fair enough. It's true that if you play a match like I had today, it's true that you are in disadvantage. Yes, but that's a special situation. I cannot complain about that, I think it's good. For me it was much more unfair when you played the US Open two days in a row, because then you are in the big disadvantage, you will play much like I played today, probably tomorrow you are dead, no chance. So that's a more disadvantage than here. I cannot say that's not fair.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern about having semifinal matches on different days, but I believe it ensures a balanced schedule for all competitors. It allows players to prepare better and reduces the risk of injuries due to consecutive matches. However, I agree that ideally, they should be played on the same day to maintain the competitive integrity of the tournament.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that you've uploaded several images, but I don't have access to video files or the ability to analyze body language from video content directly in this format.

Based on your description, the question appears to be about whether the athlete believes it's fair to have semifinals scheduled on two different days rather than played the same day. Since you mentioned analyzing facial expressions and body language, I would encourage you to describe the emotions or expressions being shown in the images you uploaded. This way, I can better infer the athlete's response based on your observations and context provided.

Alternatively, if you would like, I can help you interpret the images or help analyze other aspects based on your needs!

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a challenging situation, but it's important to maintain fairness and consistency in the tournament schedule. The decision to have semi-finals on different days is likely made to ensure that all players have an equal opportunity to perform at their best. It's crucial for the integrity of the competition that the rules are followed and that all participants are treated equally.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know if it's fair or not, but it was the same in the US Open too, so it happened before. It's not the first time that it happens. I would prefer to have the semifinals in one day, no doubt about that, because it is much more difficult to play two days back to back. But it has to be that way, it cannot be changed. So we are in this situation and we have to accept it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it’s not ideal to lose the first set, but at the same time, I just tried to reset after that and focus on what I could do better in the next set. It’s important to stay positive and keep fighting, and that’s what I tried to do out there.
