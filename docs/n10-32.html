        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't really think of myself as being seated as it's cool, but it's the same. And I still have tough matches. So it's really special when they say, when they introduced me before the match and say, okay, the number 22 seed, Dari Gavrilova from Australia. Yeah. It's just, yeah. Like I said, it's cooler, I guess, to be seated, but it doesn't make a big difference.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know, after last year, when I started my off-season, I was really focusing again on what I'm doing. And I was just trying to get in fit again, trying to go on court on every single practice and trying to improve my game, trying to improve my serve, and a lot of things which can help me to be better on court. And of course, it's always easier on practice courts than during the matches. But I had so many good matches this year already, and I'm trying to continue like that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't doubt it for a second. I've been working hard all year, and I know I have the ability to get back to this level. It's not about doubting myself, it's about pushing through the tough times and staying focused on my goals. I'm confident that I can come back stronger than ever.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Absolutely, there were moments where I doubted myself. It's a natural feeling to question if you can get back to the level you once were, especially after a period of inactivity. However, I remained committed to pushing through these doubts and worked hard to regain my form.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, there were moments when it felt overwhelming, when I doubted myself. But I just kept reminding myself that I could keep pushing forward, that giving up was never an option. It’s about finding that strength within and believing in my ability to come back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was never really sure that I'm going to come back. I mean, you never know. You don't know what's going on with your body. But I just took it day by day. And I saw the first goal of the season was to play here and to be in the second week. So I played a couple of matches in Europe. Then I stopped. It was not easy. The shoulder was bad. When I came back, I had a lot of pain. That's why I didn't play for a while. After this, of course, it was better.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was just kind of surreal. It's a very different situation for me. I mean, I had to be prepared for the fact that I was going to win. And then, you know, that it's going pretty deep into the tournament. So I just, yeah, it definitely felt different.

I don't know if I'm going to sleep. I just continue with the next day.

I think I've been playing some really good tennis, I was able to get through the first few rounds and then really find a rhythm with my game. And I feel like I found my way through that. Obviously, every match is different, but I really enjoyed every single match. So I can't complain.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know how bad it is, normally if you have something like a severe, serious ankle injury, you can't put weight on your foot. With ankles, they normally feel a bit worse, 20-30 minutes after you stop moving around on them, so it's a little bit stiff just now, but it's okay, I don't think I've done too much damage.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I met Simona actually right after she matched. Well, I thought today that Serena was playing extremely well. I think it was her best match of all here. She was serving amazing and she was playing very deep so I really couldn't play what I wanted to do. So well, if she will play like this in the final, it's going to be very hard for Simona, but Simona has also her weapons and you never know, every day is different, but so far like today she was playing amazing.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important for Serena to focus on maintaining her consistency and finding new ways to adapt to her opponents' styles. She has a great track record and I believe if she continues to work on improving her serve and her footwork, she can definitely find ways around Simone Hall. It's all about staying resilient and persistent on court.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's important to approach each match with a clear strategy. To beat Serena, it requires consistency and focus, playing smart points and not letting her dominate. One has to stay calm under pressure and capitalize on every opportunity. Of course, it’s also crucial to have a solid mental game.
