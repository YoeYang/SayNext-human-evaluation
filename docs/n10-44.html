        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, I think it was okay. I lost to a better player who was playing very well tonight. You know, hung in there and gave himself chances at some point. And stayed calm. It's not always easy, especially for a younger guy, so credit to him for taking care of that. And, yeah, I mean, look conditions also change throughout the match, like every year when you started seven and you go into the night, it gets harder to go through the opponent. And, yeah, I thought conditions were definitely a bit slower this year than last year, you know. Didn't allow for as much variation, to be quite honest, but he did a nice job of taking care of his half-vollies, you know, and that's maybe what won him the match tonight, I'm not sure.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it's a good thing to start off with a win. I played a solid match. It's always nice to go up against someone that you know you're going to have to play a certain level to beat. He has been playing really well this tournament. And it was just nice, you need to kind of, well, serve well and you got to get in the return games and, and just, just do the basics well.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I cannot directly predict an athlete's response based on images alone, especially without a clear context or knowledge of their state of mind at that moment. However, based on the body language and expression observed in the provided photos, the athlete seems to be in a focused, serious mood, which could suggest he is thinking carefully about the reporter's question. His slightly furrowed brow and posture indicate concentration and possibly a moment of contemplation.

Given the question about performance in hot conditions and self-assistance, he might respond thoughtfully about managing physical exertion or staying focused despite the heat.

He might say: 

*"Well, it's definitely tough to play in those conditions, but you have to trust your training and experience. Hydration, mental focus, and managing your energy throughout the match are key. At home, it's about maintaining a routine that keeps me sharp even in challenging weather."*

This response aligns with his serious demeanor and thoughtfulness in addressing performance-related questions.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know, just when she was walking towards the net, I could tell that she was quite upset. And I kind of liked that. You know, it shows that she wasn't there just to play a good match. She was there to win, and she wasn't, you know, she wanted to win. So that was, you know, really broke my heart. You know, I think I really, she's such a good talent. So it's good to see that attitude.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I don't want to go into too much detail, but I could see she was really emotional after the match. I wanted to make sure she was okay, and at that moment, I just felt it was important to support her. It's always tough in those situations, but I didn't mean to upset her. I think it was more about just checking in on her well-being." 

The athlete appears visibly somber and introspective in the photos provided, possibly suggesting that they might offer a response focused on sensitivity and emotional support.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, when she came over to the net, she seemed really frustrated and upset. She was shouting at me, saying that I had played a bad shot. I tried to calm her down and explain that it was just the heat of the moment, but she was really angry. It was difficult for me to keep my composure and not let her affect my game. Overall, I think she just wanted to vent her frustration and get it off her chest.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was just telling her to just relax and calm down and that she was really upset. She was crying. I don't know. It's a part of the game. Sometimes things don’t go your way. You just have to deal with it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I apologize for what I said. It was not my intention to upset her. I noticed she was upset after the match and approached her to offer support.

        <legend>Question 3（ID 300）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I thought about the match in Montreal. I knew that she was injured back then, but I knew that I have to play similar tennis fast, quick and to stay very close to the baseline, which I did great today and also to serve well, because she returns pretty strong. She stays into the court and she takes the return very fast. So, yeah, I think I played smart aggressive and also I moved her a lot, so I think that's why I could win.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, um, I was really focused on maintaining a positive mindset and staying aggressive from the beginning. I wanted to make sure I played with confidence and took control of the match early on. My tactical approach was to focus on my serve and to keep moving forward, capitalizing on any opportunities that arose.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>So and so. I can say I had a feeling that even if I didn't have so many matches before the tournament, I have a chance because the tennis was there, even with Barty. Even if I lost that match, I felt that I played a good level of tennis. But also I thought that it's going to be tough to win against Canepi because of all the reasons. But also I had in my mind that she didn't play since we were in the same position. But I didn't think that much about the result, to be honest.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's important to stay focused and not get too caught up in expectations. I knew I had a tough match against Spardi, but I didn't think too much about the potential outcomes or who else might be on my side. I just tried to stay present and give it my all on the court. As for facing Venus, I was surprised, but I'm always ready for a challenge. Confidence is key, but it's not everything. I learned a lot from that experience and it definitely helped me grow as a player.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Looking back, I can't say I had high expectations for the tournament. There were moments of uncertainty and low confidence, especially after the tough match against Spardi. However, as I progressed and saw the draw, my mindset shifted. I knew that to perform well, particularly against top players like Venus and potentially Serena, was a challenge. Despite the pressure, it was crucial for me to stay focused and committed to my game plan. It's hard to say if I expected to reach the third round, but I did my best to approach each match with determination and resilience.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I was very happy with the way I was able to assert myself from the very beginning and also to tighten up my game a bit as that first set went on and just maintain my level to the very end. Again, someone like Caroline, she's not going to give it to you so you really do have to earn it and win it till the very last point so I'm very happy I was able to just keep that pressure on.</div>

Like I said, it's cooler, I guess, to be seated, but it doesn't make a big difference.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I’m definitely pleased with the wins so far, especially with the tough matches against Del Potro. But there’s still a lot of work ahead, and I’m focusing on giving my best against Nini. I’m enjoying my tennis, but I know it’s important to stay grounded and keep pushing myself.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, as you said, it was a good start. I had a good chances, you know, a couple set points, but then, you know, I mean, I think he just gets more confident after he saved the first set. And then it was very difficult with him again, because it's, you know, he was after basically being all set down, you know, it gives you a lot of boost, and especially with him, most, I think that was just the deciding thing. So, you know, I mean, everything is if, but winning a first set then would be a completely different story.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think he played a bit better than me in the second set. And I didn't serve as many as I wanted to in that set, but then I got broken again in a row. But I just wanted more and more. I was getting more tired, of course, and then he was playing better and better. So that's what happened.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for that observation. I think the key to turning around in the first set was maintaining my focus and composure even when I faced pressure. It was crucial to stay disciplined with my shots and to execute the game plan we had prepared. This allowed me to regain momentum and ultimately win the set. Thanks for asking.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think the key turning point was when my opponent started to find his rhythm, and I maybe lost a bit of my momentum. It became challenging to maintain the same level of intensity, and he played really well from that point on. I think he deserved the win today.
