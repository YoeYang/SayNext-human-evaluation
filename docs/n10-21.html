        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think the next big meeting is going to be around the Indian waltz anyway, so that's what's going to happen at the end of the day. That's why there is a board and a council. It's for them to decide what's happening. But dressing as long as the other players had is not guilty. So as long as he didn't go to the court yet, it's tough to say something.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I'm not comfortable, but I can't be uncomfortable. I respect, obviously, what he's going through. And I don't want to get into the specifics of it, because I think we're all aware of what's happening. But, you know, he has a lot of time to think about it. He's a great guy. We all respect him. So, yeah, it's, we'll be able to cope with it and, hopefully, continue to do his job.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand that the situation you are describing is complex and can be quite stressful. It's understandable that you would be concerned about the ongoing discussions and developments. However, as an athlete, I need to focus on my performance and not let external factors distract me. As for Justin Gimelstab's role, it is ultimately up to the board to decide if he should continue in his capacity. I will trust that they have made the best decision for the tournament and its participants. Thank you for bringing this up.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, to be honest, these are complex issues, and I think it's important to carefully assess the facts before making any decisions or judgments. Regarding the discussions happening behind the scenes, I trust that the people involved are following a process that ensures fairness and transparency. As for Justin’s situation, it’s not up to me to decide, but I believe any ongoing legal matters should be taken into account when evaluating someone's role. I’ll leave it to the responsible parties to handle.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No difference. I was nervous just the same for a first round as I always am and looking one match at a time and not looking past that and just trying to remember what I did well at the US Open but other than that not really thinking about it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels incredible to be back at a slam, especially after such a challenging time. The atmosphere is electric, and the energy in the arena is palpable. There's a sense of nostalgia mixed with excitement, knowing that I've been through this before. The feeling is unique, but it's also empowering to realize how far I've come and how much I've grown. Being in the final of my last slam was an unforgettable experience, and now being here again, it's like stepping into a familiar yet exhilarating chapter.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a very different sensation to be back at a slam after being in the final of my last slam. The anticipation and the pressure are immense, but it's also incredibly motivating. It makes me feel more determined and focused than ever before.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, it's always a good feeling to be in a slam and to play a tournament, but especially this year starting off the year, I played a few tournaments and I wasn't really happy with the way I started the season, so I'm just really glad to get here and be able to compete and hopefully win matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the times have changed a lot, and people are becoming more open-minded about these things. For me, it’s about working with the best person for the job, and that’s exactly what I’ve done. I haven’t faced any negative reactions, and honestly, I think people respect a decision that’s based on professionalism and results.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I can understand why some players might have had concerns when Andy hired Amelie a few years ago, but I personally had no issues with her joining the team. Amie is a talented and professional coach, and I believe her experience and skills have been very beneficial to our team's performance. I think it's important to focus on the results and the contributions that coaches bring to the table, rather than their background or past experiences. As for the comment about hiring a dog, I would say that's a bit extreme and not reflective of the actual quality of Amélie's coaching. We should celebrate her successes and focus more on her ability to help us improve on court, not on rumors or hearsay.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the times have changed. I don't think you can't have the same reaction to that nowadays. It's just a different time and it's a new time. And I respect Andy for doing it. He did it for the right reasons.

        <legend>Question 4（ID 318）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It's pretty similar because I think I went back to sleep around five, so it's very messed up. Because you don't know what to do the next day. Because you wake up very late, you're still tired from the match, and you messed up a little bit the normal circumstances of a day off of matches. I just deal with it the better I can, and today I was happy to, you know, I'm done so I can rest and recover. What time did you wake up? At 11.30 more or less. So there's not a lot of sleep, but I can't sleep longer than that. It's weird for my body too, so I was early, I was waking up a lot, but I just, I won. I went through it, so I hope it's not going to happen again that late.</div>

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> The hardest part was definitely the recovery. After a long day's play, the physical and mental exhaustion takes a toll, making it challenging to recover swiftly. The preparation, although demanding, is more structured and predictable. Recovery, on the other hand, involves dealing with the immediate aftermath of the match, managing sore muscles, and getting back to peak performance as quickly as possible.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I think the hardest part was definitely the recovery. After finishing that late, it’s tough to get the body back to a level where you can perform again, but I had to focus on staying patient and trusting the process." 

The athlete appears to be focused and perhaps a bit tired, which suggests that recovery after a late match could have been the main challenge. Their serious facial expression and the posture indicate deep contemplation, which aligns with the idea of discussing the difficulties of recovery.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean for me it's all about recovery, it doesn't matter what time you finish the match. It's about the next day and you have to be ready and I was fine. I had a good sleep and yeah, I think it was the preparation for the final.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>A special moment, walking out on the court, and a special moment after match point or just before match point, when you get to match point and when you win the match point. I think those three components make it special when you're coming back. Obviously last year it also felt special in a way in Monaco when I came back after my first surgery ever. So yeah, you definitely see things a bit different when you've been gone for a long time or when you've come back from injury like I have in the last year or so. I've experienced it twice now. So yeah, it was great to be out there. I really enjoy myself, even though it wasn't so simple.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I was sick, and I had to stay home for a few weeks. And then I came back, but I just felt like I needed to go home. I couldn't think of coming back to the tour for my first round. So I took the decision to say, hey, let's just take a bit more time. It's been a while since I've had the time off. But it was tough because I felt that I lost a lot of ranking points. That's what I'm worried about. You know, the ranking is not the most important thing, it's the health. When you are healthy, you can always come back and do the things.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels like a process, you know? Coming back from a break or time away always brings a range of emotions—frustration, excitement, but also a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to play again. I'm just taking it one step at a time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, it's disappointing, but at the same time I have nothing to be mad at myself. I did everything that I could. And, you know, I'm not sure if I would have done anything differently, so I don't really think about that.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I think that was the key at the end, that I really could run forever. I was feeling that I was running from the first point until the last point. A lot of meters actually, but I think she played an amazing match. It's always tricky to play against, so I played once against her like a few years ago. But how she played today, it was really good. Actually, I'm really happy about how I was able to change the match and turn around and playing good tennis again in the important moments, especially in the third set.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> That last set was quite challenging, but I managed to push through it. I felt a bit fatigued towards the end, so I had to really dig deep and rely on my training. The endurance aspect of my sport is crucial, and today's performance was a testament to that. It was all about maintaining my pace and focusing on each step to get through that set.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was mentally prepared for the fact that it's going to be a tight match and I had to stay there for long. So I don't know, I just went out there to enjoy it, to fight and to leave everything out on court. And I didn't care the result at the end. I played great tennis and yeah, just happy to go out and play in front of my family and friends.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I can't say for certain what was weighing on both of our minds during the first game. However, I think it's safe to assume that both players were focused on their goals and the importance of the match. The pressure of playing for significant titles like my 15th and his 18th would certainly add an extra layer of intensity to the game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a lot of pressure, yes. We are both playing for something important, and sometimes that can weigh on your mind. I tried to focus on the game, but it's not easy when you're playing for such big titles.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I don't know, because I had a tough match the day before. It was a long match and I was playing against John Isner, which was not easy, so I didn't have the chance to think about it. But I know that he is a fighter. He is competitive and he deserves it, but I think that I am also a good player. I played some good matches here in Australia and here, in Brisbane and Sydney. So I have a lot of confidence and my game is good. And I believe that if I keep working hard, one day I can win another title.
