              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's the same. I think that's always been my mindset, is that I'm going to win. It doesn't matter what tournament I go into. So it's no different this time. This is my 21st Grand Slam. And it doesn’t matter how many times I've been here. As long as I step foot on the court, I expect to leave with the trophy.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I've been coming here for many years now, and my confidence has only grown with each visit. The atmosphere here is always inspiring, which helps me prepare and perform at my best. Each time I come, I feel more and more determined to do my very best and give it my all. It's an honor to be part of this tournament, especially with such a supportive community here. Thank you again for asking.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. It's always exciting to compete at a tournament like the Australian Open, where the level of competition is so high. Each time I come here, I feel a mix of excitement and determination. I've been fortunate enough to have had success in the past, but I never take it for granted. Every match is a new challenge, and I approach each one with the same level of focus and preparation. I'm confident in my abilities, but I also know that there are many talented players here, so I remain humble and ready to learn from every experience.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I was focused on myself for sure but also I was thinking how to play her to finish the points quicker but she was returning every single ball and that 4-3 in the second set when I had the break point that ball when she touched the line got me down a little bit but still I know that she's a fighter so I knew I have to stay there and just to keep the balance between fighting and also controlling myself.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> During the match today, I had a lot of focus on myself as I was trying to maintain my performance. I didn't really have time to pay much attention to the caravan. My main focus was on executing my plays and contributing to our team's success.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think that's a good way. But I mean, I know her, we played a couple of times, but I don't really know what she's going to do, what her plan is. So I just, you know, it's not really important for me. I have my game plan and I'm going for that.

        <legend>Question 3（ID 103）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think it's faster but not only because of the roof but also because it's much warmer than the last day. What I played against Oztapenko was definitely colder than it was today, so I felt like it was really fast. I don't know, maybe the court is faster as well or maybe with the lights I just felt it was fast. Even Dasha is not playing that fast but I still felt it was faster.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, no, I think it's just more difficult to play in the conditions than when it was open. So, you know, it can be a little bit more tricky, but not much different. But still, those are good conditions, and I really enjoy playing in that kind of weather.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The conditions with the roof closets are indeed faster, and I can see why you might think so. The roof closets provide a more controlled environment, which allows for better airflow and temperature regulation. This results in a more consistent and efficient performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. I'm glad you noticed the improvement in speed with the roof closures. We've been working on optimizing the system, and it seems to be making a significant difference. If you have any more questions about our recent updates or other areas of improvement, feel free to ask!

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, good question. I don't think I probably didn't really put this high goals in my mind. I never really put this ranking-wise to my head. So I wanted to be back on my greatest level probably as I played before. I knew it would be very, very difficult because my hand is not 100% and never will be. So it's just how it is. I'm just trying to take maximum from the minimum. And yeah, I feel great. I'm playing great tennis and I don't think that I could really imagine the time to be kind of this player again. So yeah, great.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I never lost my belief in myself, even after the challenges I faced two years ago. I kept working hard, staying focused, and constantly improving. This journey has been a testament to the power of resilience and determination. It's an incredible feeling to be back at this level, close to being world number two, but my journey is far from over. There is always more to learn, more heights to reach, which is what I love about this sport. The support from my team, fans, family, friends, has played a significant role in helping me get here. Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue pushing myself and seeing what the future holds.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's been a tough journey, but I always believed in my ability to come back stronger. I'm grateful for all the support and hard work that has brought me here. Reaching world number two on Monday is a testament to that perseverance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a tough journey, but I always believed in my ability to come back stronger. Two years ago was a challenging time, but it taught me resilience and determination. To reach this level again, I had to work tirelessly, both physically and mentally. It's not just about the ranking; it's about the hard work, the sacrifices, and the belief in myself. Getting back to this level was never about the number on the scoreboard; it was about proving to myself that I could overcome obstacles and come out even stronger. And now, standing here today, I am proud of what I have achieved.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was a little bit disappointed that I wasn't in the top 10 at the beginning of the year. But I thought that the second half of last year, I played really good tennis and I made a few wins against some good players and really top players. So I knew that my level was good and that if I continued working hard and continued to play well, then I would have a chance to be in top level. And I'm very happy that it's happening now.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expressions and body language in the images you've uploaded, the athlete appears to be focused and in a reflective state, potentially processing the question seriously. Their posture suggests they are attentive but also perhaps feeling slightly reserved. Given the context of the question regarding an ankle injury, it's likely that the athlete will give a thoughtful, measured response.

**He/She will say**: "The ankle is holding up, but I'm taking it day by day. It's been a challenge, but I'm doing my best to manage it."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The athlete's facial expression and body language suggest that they are experiencing some discomfort or pain. They may respond with something like:

"Thank you for asking. It's been tough, but I'm trying to manage the pain as best I can. The ankle is still a bit sore, but I'm hopeful that it will improve with time."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a great feeling to know that despite the challenges and setbacks, I was able to maintain my skills and confidence on the court. The support from Alison and my team was crucial in helping me bounce back and stay competitive. Knowing that I have that ability and energy has given me a sense of security and motivation to continue pushing forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It felt really good to know that I still have that kind of speed and energy, especially after everything I’ve been through recently. It’s validation of the hard work I’ve put in to stay fit and ready. Being able to turn those drop shots into points was really satisfying.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it was definitely a good mindset to have going into the match. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I definitely felt that I had to play my game and I was going to be aggressive and kind of play through it. And yeah, she obviously has a lot of power and she hits the ball clean, so you have to take your chances when you get the chance to do so.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a really important moment for me. Knowing that I had that court coverage and that energy, it gave me so much confidence. It was amazing to see how Alison dropped-shotted me and I knew I had the ability to make her pay for it. It was a great feeling to know that I had that court coverage and that energy, and it really helped me through the last few months.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it's just so exciting. I mean, these are the moments we train and we practice and we prepare for. And, you know, sitting down with my team late last year, it was one of the goals that we set out, that we wanted to go deep into Slams. And I felt like that was the next step for me. And it's amazing that it's happened in Australia and is happening in Australia. And I've given myself the opportunity and the chance to play in front of the best crowd in the world on one of the best courts in the world in my home slam. There's absolutely nothing better.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Right now I'm not happy but I'm not depressed either. It's fine, it's the tennis match. I've learned to take tennis matches as tennis matches and not the end of the world.

It's just part of the journey, and I'm committed to continuing to improve and give my best effort.

I try to maintain a positive outlook and focus on learning from every experience. It's important to stay resilient and keep pushing forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I'm not, like, pessimistic. I have a pretty positive outlook on things. Obviously, there are a lot of things that I would like to change. There's a few things I've changed. A lot in the last year and a half. And obviously, when you're losing and you don't have the best result, it's not the nicest thing. But at the same time, these things happen. So I just try to learn from it, take the good from this.
