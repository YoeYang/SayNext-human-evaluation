        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know, it was good. I was never two sets of love up and then two sets all. So that was my first time today. And it's definitely helpful that I won this match. And I'm still in the tournament first of all, but also for myself. It's very helpful as well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was really impressed with the way they were able to close out the match. Mentally, it was a tough one for both of us, but physically, I think I had the edge. It was a great game and I'm glad we were able to come out on top.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was definitely a tough challenge, both physically and mentally, but I felt prepared.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was quite impressed both mentally and physically. The ability to close out emphatically is something that takes a lot of focus and concentration, but it's also a testament to the hard work and dedication that both of us have put in. It's always great to see that all of our efforts pay off in the end.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Of course, they were dominating. I was watching a lot of players, so they were winning Grand Slams and obviously being at the top of the game and playing really powerful. So that's what I can remember and obviously big champions.

However, I prefer to focus on my own game and preparation rather than solely on the next opponent. I'll make sure to review her matches and strategies to be ready for the upcoming round.

And then getting number six here, number 20 overall, it's just a very special moment, defending my title from last year, that the fairytale continues. That's what stands out for me, and not maybe equaling Emerson or Novak. They had their own unbelievable careers, and I admire what they're doing and what they've done with them also.

It's a moment that I'll cherish for a lifetime. The hard work, dedication, and countless hours spent on this journey have all culminated in this amazing achievement. I feel extremely grateful and honored to join their ranks.

It's tough to say that I deserve it more than they do. But I have to earn it. He's earned it with his hard work and dedication. They've been through so many injuries and stuff. All sorts of stuff have happened. You know, it hasn't been easy for them either.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a tremendous feeling to be able to achieve such a milestone. Equaling the achievements of legends like Emerson and Djokovic is a true honor, especially in front of such an iconic backdrop. The Australian Open holds a special place in my heart, and to have this accomplishment here is truly surreal. It's not just about personal achievement; it's about the journey, the hard work, and the support from everyone who has believed in me along the way. This title represents more than just a number; it's a testament to perseverance, dedication, and the love of the sport.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I definitely think that a lot of things have gone right in the last two weeks, and I definitely feel like I've been really lucky. But at the same time, I also believe that luck is a small part of it, especially when you've worked so hard and put in so much effort. It's definitely a combination of both. I believe in my abilities and the preparation that I put into this, but I do also feel that some luck has been on my side. So, yes, in this case, third time lucky is definitely something I can believe and be grateful for.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I do believe in luck, but at the end of the day, it's all about the hard work and effort you put in. Maybe this is my lucky moment, but I’ve definitely worked for it!

              <strong>Answer：</strong> One story that comes to mind is from my first match in the Australian Open. I remember being extremely nervous, but as soon as I stepped onto the court, I could feel the energy and excitement. That moment truly embodied the spirit of Andre Agassi, where I knew I had to give it my all, regardless of the pressure. It was a defining moment for me and set the tone for the rest of my career.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "Honestly, it's tough to pin down just one moment because he had such a unique personality both on and off the court. If I had to choose, I’d say it’s the way he could transform the energy of a match, flipping the momentum with his showmanship and incredible talent.”

              <strong>Answer：</strong> One story that stands out to me was during a match against Andre Agassi. It was a tough game, and I remember feeling the pressure to perform well. However, instead of letting it get to me, I focused on my own game and played with confidence. The crowd's energy was electric, and I fed off their support. In the end, we won the match, and it was a moment of pure joy and relief. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best performances come when you're able to block out distractions and just focus on the game.

He's a great entertainer, he loves to come to the court and he likes to speak a little bit, so it's nice to play him.
