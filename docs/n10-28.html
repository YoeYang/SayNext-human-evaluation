              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I'm happy. I think I did some things pretty well. It's not easy to play a match like this, especially against Rafa. He's the best player in history and he plays so well on this court, on Laver Cup. So it's great to be in the third round and I hope to improve for the next one.

I was really calm on myself and really positive, so that was the best thing to do today.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. I appreciate the recognition of my ground strokes. However, I believe that my improvement comes from a combination of factors. It includes not only the physical aspects but also the mental and strategic aspects of the game. While my focus on ground shots has been crucial, it's also been important for me to develop a better understanding of game tactics and positioning. This has allowed me not just to hit the ball harder, but to make more strategic and effective decisions on the court. So, in summary, my progress is a result of a holistic approach involving physical strength, mental clarity, and tactical understanding.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand that not being able to fight for my first semi-final at a Grand Slam is a difficult situation. The emotions running through me right now include disappointment, frustration, and a sense of missed opportunity. It's disheartening to be unable to compete at this level after all the hard work and preparation. However, I'm determined to learn from this experience and use it as motivation to come back stronger next time.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>play. Thank you. Yeah, but I can say nothing. I think this loss was like the one of the most painful in my tennis career, which it's not really something which I wanted to repeat for sure. I don't think that, you know, the past can repeat very similarly. So it doesn't matter what happened that year. I'm just here and playing and enjoying and that's important.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "Yes, I remember that match very well. It was such a tight and emotional contest, and I definitely had my chances. Losing such a close match was tough, especially with so much on the line, but I try not to dwell on it too much. It was a great experience, and I learned a lot from that moment." 

Based on the body language and expressions in the images, Petra seems to be in a reflective state, indicating that the question brings up memories that might be bittersweet. She is likely to acknowledge the importance of the match but focus on how she has grown from it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I remember that match very well. It was a tough one, and it definitely was close. I felt like I played well, but Maria was also playing at a very high level. In the end, it just came down to a few critical points that went her way. That's sports, you know. You win some, lose some. But I definitely learned a lot from that experience, which helped me in my subsequent matches.

I'm not starting from zero. There's a lot to build from and I know that maybe is not what you want to hear, but personally that's important for me. There's a lot of things I need to improve on. And as I said, this is a process and this is a lot of things that take time to be able to get these matches and players that are playing this well and I'm going to face a lot of them this year and I'll have to bring in.

And I know she's a great player and it's not easy to play against Serena, because she makes a lot of balls and you have to stay there for long. But I thought I played well, played aggressive.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. During the match, I was focused on maintaining my composure and executing my strategy. I tried to stay calm and collected, even when things were going well. My primary thought was to continue playing consistently and supporting my team. The process was challenging, but I enjoyed being part of it and learning from the experience.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> During the match, I was just trying to stay focused on each point, not thinking too much ahead. I felt confident when I found my rhythm, and everything seemed to be falling into place. I was just trying to maintain that momentum and stay in the zone.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> But I had a tough second set and he played really good. So I think I have to be more focused and more aggressive. And I was not focused enough. Yeah, it's tough. But anyway, I'm really happy to play five sets against the champion.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was really focused on the game and trying to stay in the moment. I knew that I had to keep my composure and not let any mistakes get me down. I was able to block out all the noise and distractions and just concentrate on my own performance.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yes and no. I was just a little bit surprised that I won the first set because at the beginning I felt the worst. And then just because I was up and down so much with my focus and I was not able to just block that out but I'm feeling the ball well. I was hitting it good and when I'm set, when I'm in position, I was middling it really well I was hitting a lot of good balls and just in some areas I'm blocked and that's the case. It's difficult to match these guys and to continue to go through the tournament with just a little bit of an advantage in physicality.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I was a bit surprised, to be honest. I wasn't feeling at my best out there, but I gave it everything I had. Taking it to five sets shows how much fight I had despite the condition I was in.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was surprised that I won in four sets, to be honest. But yeah, I mean, that's how it goes. It's a five-set match. You're in trouble at 4-2, 40-15 in the fifth. He was serving great. I got lucky with the call on the second serve. And then I started to play better. So it's like this. That's what you do in five sets.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I was quite surprised that I managed to take it to five sets given my condition. I didn't expect to be able to push through as well as I did, but I'm glad I could give it my all and compete to the best of my ability.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern about the scheduling. It's important to note that in tennis, a lot of factors go into the decision-making process, including the players' form, the stage of the tournament, and the overall narrative. While it's true that some of my opponents were lower-ranked, I try to approach every match with the same intensity and focus. Ultimately, it comes down to my performance on the court. I don't dwell too much on my opponent's ranking or the seating arrangement.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's just the way things work in tennis. Sometimes you play on different courts and have different opponents, but it doesn't really matter to me. I'm just focused on my own game and trying to do my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I noticed that, but honestly, it's not something I focus on. I just try to adapt to any court I’m scheduled on and prepare for my matches. I’ll leave those decisions to the organizers.
