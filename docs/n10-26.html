              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it's always a great feeling to be the number one player in the world. And it doesn't, there's not a lot of players that can say that they're number, they've been number two, you know, in their career. So it was always very important to me to try to get to number number. I think it is.

        <legend>Question 2（ID 223）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, to be honest, I was always hungry for success because if I'm not, then I would probably not need to be competing at this level and traveling. Because then I wouldn't be true to myself. And then it would be probably a waste of time. It's not only about success. For me, this is a school of life or a learning journey of life for me. And I've said it before, the tennis court is a place where I'm naked, where I'm exposed to both extremes in terms of emotions and character. And that's where I probably learned the most about myself, or have the opportunity to learn about myself. And what was your question again? I just think... Yes.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've always been driven to succeed, and I believe that's what keeps me going. As I enter the later years of my career, my hunger for success has only grown stronger. Every match, every tournament, I see it as an opportunity to prove myself and continue to push the boundaries of what I can achieve. It's not just about the victories or the accolades; it's about leaving a legacy that will inspire future generations of athletes.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, it's always tough to answer that. I think I know what I have to do to compete at a high level. And I've spoken about it before, I don't need to prove anything to anybody anymore. It's just, you know, hopefully I can continue playing well. There's a lot of guys that are playing at high levels. So I need, if I want to win tournaments, to play better than them. That's my only goal.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for your question. I'm always motivated to perform well, regardless of the tournament or the year. I've had many successes throughout my career, and I'm eager to continue competing at the highest level. Each match is a new opportunity to showcase my skills and strive for excellence.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. I still feel the same passion and hunger for the game as I did earlier in my career. Matches like tonight remind me why I keep pushing myself. I love competing at the highest level, and I'm motivated to achieve more while I still can.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not sure. I mean, I've always had a lot of trouble with my backhand because I like to go for my shots. So sometimes I just don't get there in time and I don;t get enough power on it. But today it was working really well and she was coming up with a good return.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the compliment. I've been working on my backhand a lot lately, so it's nice to see it pay off. It's definitely one of my go-to shots, but I'm always looking to improve and try new things on the court.

        <legend>Question 5（ID 361）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Of course she's an aggressive player so she's going to have better matches and worse matches. I think this, like I said, it was maybe her best match in the life from my kind of view. I don't think she did anything wrong really. She just went for it completely and she deserved to win, of course. And she's a great player so I didn't expect that she's going to play bad match but maybe with more mistakes. I think for sure she can play with more mistakes so she didn't today.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the athlete's facial expression and body language, which suggests a combination of focus and possible frustration, it seems that she is processing the question carefully but may feel a bit irritated or uncomfortable. Her posture indicates a defensive or guarded stance, potentially indicating a reluctance to give an immediate answer or a need to take a moment before responding.

She might say:

**"I think every match is different, and Naomi has a very unique game. Her serves and variety of shots are always a challenge, but I’m focused on my own game and adjusting to the situation as it comes."**

This response would be measured, acknowledging the opponent's strengths without diving into specifics, which seems in line with her body language of cautiousness and contemplation.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, of course I'm aware of the way she's been playing. I know that she has a very big serve. She likes to serve big and then try to go for a lot of first serves. And then she can also play very aggressive. So I always try my best to be there, try a drop shot or to try something different to make her a little bit thinking. But I think she did it really well today.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've been working hard to improve my game, and I'm always looking for ways to stay one step ahead of my opponents. Naomi is a tough player, and I know she's been practicing her serves and shots as well. It's always a challenge to read her game and anticipate what she might do next. But I'm confident in my abilities and my preparation, so I'm ready to face whatever she throws at me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I definitely noticed a difference in Naomi's game compared to last week. Her serves were more powerful and she had a wider variety of shots. It made the matches challenging, but I feel that I've adapted well to her style and was able to counter her moves effectively.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know, I'm not following her career so far. But like I said, I think she can be dangerous for a lot of players, especially the top, because she's playing without fear. And if there is somebody who is a little bit tight or a little bit nervous or whatever, she can be dangerous like today, she was dangerous. So I think if I'm not feeling the best, she can beat me today. But probably she's losing the different matches than against the top players, so maybe for a second round, I think, but she's still 27, it's not bad.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a good feeling. I'm happy to be in the third round, but I wanted to go further. So I'll keep working hard and hopefully I can do better next time. How was the match today? Good, good. Very happy with the way I played. Obviously I had a break down in every set, so I was a bit lucky to win every single set. But I think I stayed strong mentally, stayed focused on my own game, and just tried to do the best I could.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm just trying to mix it up and throw her off a little bit. You know, it's not really about the serve. It's just about trying different shots and different combinations. And I think that's been working well.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think she's been really consistent lately and she struggled before at Grand Slams and I think she changed her mentality and she's feeling confident and you know she just goes on about her business and does her things.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's because she's always been so consistent and reliable. She's always been someone who has put in the work and is dedicated to her craft. It's not just about her skills on the court, but also her sportsmanship and how she handles herself both on and off the court. People can see that she's a true professional and that's something that earns respect from everyone in the sport.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for bringing that up. I think what sets Carolina apart is her unwavering focus and dedication to her craft. She's always pushing herself to improve and never settles for mediocrity. That level of commitment is infectious and really motivates the rest of us to raise our game. Additionally, her strategic thinking and ability to adapt to different situations on the court have been impressive. It's not just her skill, but her mentality that inspires us all to support her here.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's the respect because I played her in Eastburn last year and I knew that she's going to be a tough opponent. And also when I saw the draw I was like, oh, it will be tough to play her. But I had the chance and she played good, she beat good players, so she deserves to win.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I think it's her consistency and ability to perform under pressure. She's been really impressive with her game, and it’s something that the players definitely respect. Everyone knows how tough she can be, especially when it matters most. It’s clear that she has a lot of belief in her own game, which definitely makes her a strong competitor."
