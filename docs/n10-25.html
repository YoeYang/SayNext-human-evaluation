And that also helps for you out there on court mentally. I'm really happy with how the body held up. Now I've just got to focus on recovering and getting ready for my next one.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was great. I mean, the stadium was full, a lot of Serbian, of course, but also a lot of French and a lot of Australian. So I think it was a nice final because I think the crowd was separate. And that was a good final anyway. So I have good memories. Of course, for me, it was, of course, disappointing to lose this one. But anyway, I was good memories. Before the come in 2008, I didn't expect to play a final. So it was already something nice, of course. I was not even seated, I think.</div>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I mean, actually, he was really good. I came back from this score because I wasn't feeling my rhythm today on the court. From the beginning, my serve wasn't working. I was doing too many mistakes, and I was just not really feeling good playing wise on the court, but somehow through the fighting and through everything, I think she even had advantage to go for five loss. So I could turn this match around, and I really, really realized it in the third set. So yeah, you sometimes lose a match like this, and you just really want to go back now, 45 minutes, and I will do things maybe differently, and I would really want to change it, but you cannot do it anymore.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I believe that the stress of coming back from losing four games in the second circuit could have a significant impact on my performance. It's definitely something I need to work on and manage better in future matches. However, I am confident that I can bounce back and perform at my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was trying to fight until the last point. I didn't give up. Even though I couldn't make a return, I tried to give everything. And in the end, he was too good. So, yeah, that's it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Oh, that's such a nice compliment from Caroline. I really appreciate her words. I felt really good out there today, and I think I was able to execute my game plan well. Everything just seemed to click, and I stayed focused throughout the match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I appreciate Caroline's kind words, but I think there are always areas for improvement, even in what might be considered the best game of my life. I felt that I executed my strategy well and stayed focused throughout the match. The key moments that went well were when I maintained my composure under pressure and made smart decisions on court. However, there's always room to grow, both individually and as a team, so I'll continue to work on refining my skills and techniques.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, it was definitely very difficult to pick one match, but, you know, today was really incredible. I think I executed my game plan really well. Obviously, Caroline's a very tough opponent to play. She's been there for a long time. So I knew I had to bring my A game. And yeah, so it's definitely up there with me.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>For me, I don't feel pressure, I feel nerves, like if that makes sense. I felt really nervous in the first round, but after that I felt really good. I've been playing really well, so for me, Grand Slams are more of an exciting time. I think there's the most attention during Grand Slams, and more people come out than anywhere else, so definitely it makes me really happy, and I try to sort of channel that in my tennis.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean I definitely do feel like I'm in a different position compared to last year. And I guess it's a good thing that I still have the chance to play here and I feel comfortable playing here. So I don't feel any extra pressure. I just feel happy to be here playing.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand the changes in my ranking and seating arrangement, but I'm focused on my game and staying grounded. I don't feel additional pressure, as I know that every match is a new opportunity to improve and perform.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> From the expression and body language of the athlete in the images, they appear to be deep in thought, slightly tense, and perhaps overwhelmed by the situation. They have a neutral, focused expression, indicating they are contemplating the question carefully, possibly trying to find a calm way to respond to the pressure.

Based on these cues, the athlete may say something like:

**"I try not to focus too much on the ranking or the seat. I take it one match at a time and just focus on doing my best. Of course, there’s always some pressure, but I think it's important to stay grounded and stay focused on my game."** 

Their response likely reflects an effort to manage the pressure by staying focused on their performance rather than external expectations.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I appreciate the recognition of my progress, but I'm focusing on the game and staying present. The pressure is there, but it's about being ready for every match.
