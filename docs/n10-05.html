        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>A little bit of emotions, maybe the leg a little bit. I was not sure how it's going to be, how I will run, because I knew I have to run and to move quick against her. She's hitting hard, so I had to stay close to the baseline and also strong. But after that, I started to feel the rhythm and I was a little bit more aggressive.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I thought it was a good point and I was trying to stay aggressive and it worked for me. So I had some points on her serve. I didn't take them and then I lost it. And she took the advantage.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>In general, over the last probably three, four tournaments I've tried always to be a bit more positive and vocal with myself. I didn't know how much of that I had in me, so I think I played at a much more monotone level to start. So I tried to get the best out of myself by pushing because I was falling a little bit behind. He was having a bit more looks on my serve, and I played that great game at 4-5 that he played phenomenal to hold on to or 4-all. I remember exactly. But I just do, try to do these little things to get a better level of tennis out of myself.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, yeah, it's definitely not the easiest thing to do. I mean, it's not like I'm in great shape or anything, but I've been working on my endurance for a while now. It's just one of those things where you have to push yourself and you have to believe in yourself. And when you're out there on the court, you can't really afford to think about how you're feeling physically. You just have to keep going and trust that your body will hold up.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just, you know, I was just talking to myself. I didn't have anyone out there. It was like one of those situations where I had to kind of get myself back into it. And I think that's something that I'm able to do well. You know. Sometimes when I am down or sometimes I can just sort of lift myself up and get back in it and play some good tennis.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, for sure. I just felt like I needed to push myself a little harder towards the end there. It wasn’t necessarily extra motivation, but I wanted to make sure I stayed focused and closed it out without letting any momentum slip. Especially since I wasn’t feeling 100%, I didn’t want to give them any chances to come back.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think when you're in a match like that, especially with a crowd like this, there's always that extra bit of energy that you draw from. It's not just about the physical aspect, but also about maintaining that mental toughness and that fire in the belly. Even if I'm feeling a bit under the weather, I know I have to give it my all. That's what makes sports so exciting, it's about pushing through those moments and coming out stronger on the other side.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I guess you could say that. That's a good way to look at it. It's been an incredible experience, and I'm so grateful to be here in Melbourne. I definitely played some tournaments in some strange places that the first year that I turned pro. So I'm really just grateful to be out here doing what I love and playing in front of a good crowd.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it would be very funny, but I don't think they would cast me, so... But yeah, it's a dream of mine. And I would love to play on a real court, not on the beach, because it was very hot, and I was not enjoying it. But still, that's the dream. I still remember that, yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's pretty cool to see the parallels between my journey and Cinderella's. Just like Cindie, I had to work hard and overcome challenges to get where I am today. But unlike Cinde, maybe I didn't have a fairy godmother, but I definitely had a lot of support from my team and family. It's definitely a 'Cinderalla ride' in some ways.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yes, it's not a problem. For me it's fair enough. It's true that if you play a match like I had today, it's true that you are in disadvantage. Yes, but that's a special situation. I cannot complain about that, I think it's good. For me it was much more unfair when you played the US Open two days in a row, because then you are in the big disadvantage, you will play much like I played today, probably tomorrow you are dead, no chance. So that's a more disadvantage than here. I cannot say that's not fair.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern about having semifinal matches on different days, but I believe it ensures a balanced schedule for all competitors. It allows players to prepare better and reduces the risk of injuries due to consecutive matches. However, I agree that ideally, they should be played on the same day to maintain the competitive integrity of the tournament.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's a challenging situation, but it's important to maintain fairness and consistency in the tournament schedule. The decision to have semi-finals on different days is likely made to ensure that all players have an equal opportunity to perform at their best. It's crucial for the integrity of the competition that the rules are followed and that all participants are treated equally.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know if it's fair or not, but it was the same in the US Open too, so it happened before. It's not the first time that it happens. I would prefer to have the semifinals in one day, no doubt about that, because it is much more difficult to play two days back to back. But it has to be that way, it cannot be changed. So we are in this situation and we have to accept it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that you've uploaded several images, but I don't have access to video files or the ability to analyze body language from video content directly in this format.

Based on your description, the question appears to be about whether the athlete believes it's fair to have semifinals scheduled on two different days rather than played the same day. Since you mentioned analyzing facial expressions and body language, I would encourage you to describe the emotions or expressions being shown in the images you uploaded. This way, I can better infer the athlete's response based on your observations and context provided.

Alternatively, if you would like, I can help you interpret the images or help analyze other aspects based on your needs!

        <legend>Question 5（ID 228）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, yeah, as I said, I was against it at 200% and I'm still against it at 200%. But now that the decision has been made and that we cannot do anything about it, we have to live with it and now it's never going to be the same anymore. It's going to be a new competition, it's not going to be the Davies Cup. I think it's a shame because the atmosphere you can live when you're playing for your country at home or even away, it's just unbelievable. There is nothing to describe the emotion you feel. So maybe it's going to be a nice competition, but it's going to look more like an exhibition than a real one. And that's what I said to Mr. Agathe or all the other person.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I mean, it's not the first time I speak out my opinion. I'm sure many players are, too. And I don't want to go too much in details, but I think it needs to be improved. It's the same as the Grand Slam, as I said. You can't say one thing is one way and the other one is another way. So it should be the player's choice to play or not to pay. If it stays like this, then it won't be really good for the sport. That's my feeling. What were your conversations like with the ITF? Honestly, not really long. Just very quick.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your concern about the Davis Cup and its significance. It's a tournament that brings a lot of excitement and passion to the sport, and I share the sentiment that it should be valued. My conversations with the head of the International Tennis Federation have been constructive, focusing on how we can maintain the essence of this competition while also adapting to modern demands and challenges. We are committed to ensuring that the spirit of Davis cup remains strong, even as we explore new ways to make it more accessible and engaging for fans and players alike.

While it's true that the event has undergone significant changes in recent years, I believe it still holds a special place in the hearts of tennis fans around the world. The International Tennis Federation has been working diligently to revitalize the tournament, focusing on creating a more exciting and engaging experience for both players and spectators. I've had several conversations with the head of the International Tennis Federation, and I'm confident that they are committed to preserving the integrity and tradition of the Davis Cup while also adapting it to meet the needs of modern audiences. It's a delicate balance, but I believe they are making progress in the right direction.

I personally would like to see it preserved in a way that respects its tradition, but at the same time, evolves to suit the modern calendar and commitments. My conversations with the ITF were constructive, and I shared my concerns, but it’s ultimately up to the governing bodies to find the right balance.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think he came up with some great shots. I mean, maybe there's a few shots, obviously, in a match of three and a half hours that you probably could have done better with. But I did also come up with the last game. I came up with some great returns. And the 30-all point, I had a great return right down to his feet and a really good lob and reflex to his smash. I read it well. He just kept coming up with great shots. I think the point before the match point, he came up with a great reflex drop folly or half folly winner. And yeah, I don't know if I returned badly. I thought I returned reasonably well. I definitely could have served better the last couple of sets that we've helped.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I've played well against all the players. I don't know if that's something special. It's not something I can really explain. But I like to play against players that I feel like I'm a good match up for. And I felt like today I had a really good chance to get through this match. So I was really happy with the way I played.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was probably a combination of both. I definitely didn’t execute my passing shots as well as I’d have liked, but at the same time, credit to him for being very solid at the net and making it tough for me. It’s something I'll need to work on moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems like the uploaded file is an image, not a video. Unfortunately, I can only analyze static images and not predict responses based on dynamic expressions or body language in a video. If you can provide more details about the athlete’s expression or body language in the image, I can make an educated guess about their potential response based on that! Let me know how you would like to proceed.
