        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No, it is relevant and it's normal that you believe that you have doubts about me because I have doubts about me, you know? It's not, of course, it's not a problem for me and I really understand 100% because I have the same doubts but it's true that if that happens 10 years ago, probably will be a much more difficult situation for me because I needed always to be on rhythm to play with the tennis. Since a while I understand that that's, of course, it's better because you feel more confident on yourself, you feel more safe when you are on rhythm but, you know, I believe that when you are older, you lose less the tennis when you are playing less, you know? You don't need that many matches to play well and that's something that happened for the last two years for me and probably one of the reasons is because I am practicing well when I am not competing and that then allows me to be back on action a little bit quicker. That's all, you know, it's not a big reason and, of course, it's an issue. It's not easy to be back after four months or five months and play the way that I am playing. Of course, I didn't expect that at all. Sorry, I forgot to answer two more questions.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your perspective, but I've been working hard during this time to prepare for this event. My focus has been on my training and improving my game. I believe that my dedication and preparation will show in my performance, regardless of the time since my last official event.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think that it's not that I'm relevant, I've been playing well the last few weeks. I have been focused on my own things, my recovery, how I feel on the court, and I was playing a good level of tennis. So I don't care if people say I am or I not relevant. That's a little bit dangerous. If you believe in that, because I believe that if you are not on court and you don´t practice every day, you can be very good. And I would like to see that happening to me. It's going to be great for me, but I can't really be that naive and that blind. You know, it has to go step by step.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it’s normal people talk about these things and analyze them, but honestly, every player is different. For me, I’ve been preparing well. It’s not about how long I’ve been away, but how I feel now. I’m here to compete, and I feel ready. Let’s see what happens.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know, I mean, yeah, it was a great get. I don't know, I didn't think much of it. I mean, it was an unbelievable shot, don't get me wrong. But yeah, I just refocused next point, and then I don't think it threw me off. But he definitely picked up his level. He started making a lot of good shots, and his forehand started penetrating me off the court. And yeah.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just tried to stay on the back foot and hit a good serve. I didn't have the best return because he was serving really good and he got the timing and everything right. So I couldn't do anything about it. But when I got that ball back, I had a chance to get it back and I missed it a little bit, but I think he played a great shot. And then the next game I broke his serve and got a break back.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was a bit tricky at first because I didn't expect him to pull off a shot like that, but I just tried to stay focused and play my game. It ended up working out for me in the end.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>It was what it needed to be. It's obviously tough to have necessarily a solid performance all the way through, but I did what I needed to. I took care of my serve. I broke quite early in all the sets, just dropped off a little bit where I faced a few sort of dangers on my service games in the beginning of the third and end of the second. But other than that, I returned pretty solid when I had to. I stepped up and I played well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not really bothered with the racket string. I think it's fine. Yeah, I mean, it just depends on how I play. If I hit a lot of slices, then obviously the strings are gonna be a little bit tighter and it won't really allow me to move around as much as I want to. But it doesn't bother me too much.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the provided images and observing the athlete's body language and facial expression, the athlete appears to be tired or disinterested, possibly signaling frustration or weariness. He is resting his chin on his hand and seems to be looking off to the side, which may suggest a lack of engagement or discomfort with the question.

He will likely respond with:  
**"Honestly, it’s not something I really focus on during the match. Sometimes it can be an issue, but I don’t let it affect my game too much."**

This response would match the nonchalant or dismissive tone that might accompany his current demeanor.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Oh, that? It was totally spontaneous! I was just in the moment, and the music sort of got to me. I guess I just let loose after such an exciting match!

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a bit spontaneous, actually. I was feeling a little bit nervous after the match and I just let loose a bit and started dancing. It wasn't something I had planned, but it felt good to let off some steam.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, the jig was somewhat spontaneous. I was feeling the music and just let myself move with the rhythm of the moment. It was a fun way to express my joy and energy after the match."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was planned. I know there's a lot of people who are watching on TV. So I wanted to be on the screen. But I mean, I didn't even finish the song. It's just the first part.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Not really. I mean, past is a past. I mean, I knew that he was a very tricky opponent. I know how he can play. We had quite a few battles, as you said, in the past. So, yeah, I mean, I just was looking forward to just play that match. It was the first match back for me at a slam, so I was just kind of happy to focus on my side and see where I was at.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. It's always a challenge when you've faced someone multiple times before, but I approach each match as if it's the first time. Yanko is a tough opponent, and I knew he would bring his best game today. I'm focused on what I can control and not dwell on past matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you. To be honest, it was definitely on my mind because losing to someone multiple times can be a mental hurdle. But I tried to focus on this match and stay confident in the work I’ve been putting in. It feels great to have finally overcome that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, absolutely. Losing to Yanko four times in past tournaments was definitely in my mind. It was a motivating factor for me to work harder and prepare better for this year's Australian Open. I knew I had to do better than before, and I'm glad that all the hard work paid off today."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, we've had a lot of battles and yeah, he's always been someone that's been able to raise his game when we play each other. And I've been playing well against him. I have a good record against Rafa. But it's never easy. You know, it was a big challenge for me. This was, you know what it is. It was the beginning of the year. So, yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that the provided file is an image rather than a video, so I can't analyze any facial expressions or body language from a video context. However, if you provide more details about the athlete’s expression or give a description of their body language in the image, I can give you an informed prediction about their response to the reporter’s question.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's been a journey, and I'm just happy to be back on the court. Winning a Grand Slam would be an incredible accomplishment, but it's not the only measure of success for me. I'm focused on enjoying the process and pushing myself to improve with each match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I understand that you're asking about my comeback from pregnancy and my performance in recent matches. The journey back to competing at a high level has been challenging, but I'm grateful for every opportunity to play. While I haven't won a major title yet, I've learned a lot about myself and have grown as an athlete. My focus now is on continuing to improve and give my best effort in every match. Thank everyone for their support and I look forward to what the future holds.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think all the parts of my game were pretty solid. I mean, I had some unforced errors, which I would have liked to go for less, but I'm happy that I was able to really fight through those points and get the job done.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> If I had to narrow it down to 9%, the part of my game that would let me down is my serve. I've been struggling with consistency and power on my serves lately, which has affected my overall performance in matches.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's hard to say, but probably my backhand. It hasn't been as consistent as I'd like it to be recently.
