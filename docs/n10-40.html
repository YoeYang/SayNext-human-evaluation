        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think time changed and I think he did it first, so that's why he received so many texts. It's a shame that it happened, but men are cutting women, so why not the contrary? That's... I mean, I don't get it, but as I said again and again, it's not about being a man or a woman, it's about knowing tennis, about having the good state of mind. She's a champion, she's a great coach, but to respond to your question, I didn't receive any bad message.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I can understand why some players might have had concerns when Andy hired Amelie a few years ago, but I personally had no issues with her joining the team. Amie is a talented and professional coach, and I believe her experience and skills have been very beneficial to our team's performance. I think it's important to focus on the results and the contributions that coaches bring to the table, rather than their background or past experiences. As for the comment about hiring a dog, I would say that's a bit extreme and not reflective of the actual quality of Amélie's coaching. We should celebrate her successes and focus more on her ability to help us improve on court, not on rumors or hearsay.

Each time I come here, I feel a mix of excitement and determination. I've been fortunate enough to have had success in the past, but I never take it for granted. Every match is a new challenge, and I approach each one with the same level of focus and preparation. I'm confident in my abilities, but I also know that there are many talented players here, so I remain humble and ready to learn from every experience.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, obviously I've played him a few times now. We've had some great matches. He's a great competitor. And I know he's gonna come out swinging and trying to play his best tennis. So I was definitely prepared for a lot of runs and long rallies and a fight tonight.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I went into the match feeling very confident. Despite the previous victories of Rashad, I knew that he was a formidable opponent and I had to bring my A-game. However, my confidence was not solely based on past performance but also on my preparation and mental state leading up to the game. I felt well-prepared and in a good place mentally to take on the challenge.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I felt confident, but I also knew that Rashad is a tough opponent and has a strong track record against me. So I went into the match focused and prepared for a challenge, not underestimating him despite the last result.

It's always important to keep pushing yourself and striving for improvement, and that's exactly what I did today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's because she's always been so consistent and reliable. She's always been someone who has put in the work and is dedicated to her craft. It's not just about her skills on the court, but also her sportsmanship and how she handles herself both on and off the court. People can see that she's a true professional and that's something that earns respect from everyone in the sport.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for bringing that up. I think what sets Carolina apart is her unwavering focus and dedication to her craft. She's always pushing herself to improve and never settles for mediocrity. That level of commitment is infectious and really motivates the rest of us to raise our game. Additionally, her strategic thinking and ability to adapt to different situations on the court have been impressive. It's not just her skill, but her mentality that inspires us all to support her here.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's the respect because I played her in Eastburn last year and I knew that she's going to be a tough opponent. And also when I saw the draw I was like, oh, it will be tough to play her. But I had the chance and she played good, she beat good players, so she deserves to win.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I think it's her consistency and ability to perform under pressure. She's been really impressive with her game, and it’s something that the players definitely respect. Everyone knows how tough she can be, especially when it matters most. It’s clear that she has a lot of belief in her own game, which definitely makes her a strong competitor."
