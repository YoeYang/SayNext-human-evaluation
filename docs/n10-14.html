              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I've been fortunate to have worked with many coaches throughout my career, and while I had a relationship with Nick Saviano, we parted ways. Currently, I am being coached by Farley. Farrell has been instrumental in helping me develop my skills and reach new heights in my athletic career. It's been a great learning experience, as Farleigh brings a unique perspective and expertise to our training sessions. We work closely together to ensure that I continue to grow and improve. Thanks for your interest in this aspect of my journey.

        <legend>Question 2（ID 104）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, I think she was the one who was more aggressive, so I didn't have any chance to go for my shots and play the game I'm normally playing. So she was pushing me from my second serve, even from when she serves first. She was still making the pressure on me, which cannot happen, but there can be matches like this. So I'm really happy that I got through it, and even it was not my game and it was not easy match, then it still counts, it's a win. So, I think the only thing that I'm pleased with was my serve in the third set. I think I had a high percentage of the first serve, actually, finally. Very high. Yeah, how much? 76. Yeah, I felt.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm really proud of my performance today, and I know that my stats are impressive. However, I think it's important to remember that tennis is a game of strategy and mental toughness, not just raw power. My opponent played really well, and I had to work hard to stay focused and maintain my composure. While my stats may be great, they don't tell the whole story. I believe that my experience and determination gave me an edge in this match, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to compete at such a high level.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> Because I didn't make those mistakes. I was just a few steps away, a little bit far from my box. And the point where I had the break point, I missed my shot. But I think she played good. She was playing very aggressive. Also, she was very focused. So, yeah, just...

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think she just outplayed me in the key moments. Even though my stats might look good overall, I felt like she was dictating the pace and I was reacting more than imposing my game. Sometimes it's not just about the numbers but how the match feels on court, and today it felt like she controlled the important points better.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your perspective, but I think it's important to consider the context of the match. While I had some impressive stats, the level of play was incredibly high, and I believe my opponent played exceptionally well. It's not about individual statistics but about the overall performance and how we both contributed to the game. I'm proud of what I achieved, even if it wasn't enough to come out on top.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I don't want to speculate too much about next week. I'll just focus on taking things day by day, listening to my body, and making sure I'm fully prepared to give my best on the court. Of course, I’m aware of the challenges, but I’m determined to keep pushing forward." 

This response aligns with the athlete's focused and somewhat thoughtful expression, indicating a careful and professional approach to dealing with potential challenges while maintaining optimism and resilience.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely a contrast from the first set. I think in the second set, I just focused more on my game and stuck to my strategy. I tried not to overthink it and just went with what was working. Momentum can be tricky, but I felt like I was able to adjust quickly and not let the momentum shift too much. It’s always about staying in the moment and not getting caught up in the highs and lows.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I just felt like my game was working. I was hitting a lot of clean balls and I felt that I had a good chance to finish the points and the match. So I think that gave me the momentum. And then I started to feel more relaxed.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, thank you for that follow-up question. It's always interesting to analyze how momentum shifts during a game, especially when it comes to the second set. For me, it started with a sense of focus and determination. I knew that I had to stay aggressive and not let my opponent settle into a rhythm. My serving was critical, as I wanted to put pressure on them from the very beginning. Additionally, my footwork and positioning on the court allowed me to cover more ground and anticipate their shots. This gave me a slight edge early on, which helped me build the momentum I needed to sustain throughout the set.

But, yeah, first round it's always tricky and I didn't feel that good in the first set there.

But overall, I think in the second set, it improved a little bit the game, so yeah. But not the best, I would say.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I think that's a good point. I definitely need to work on my first serves. It's important to improve those percentages going into the second round.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think it's a great confidence boost. I was a little bit down on myself in the second set, but I really wanted to win that set. So I'm really happy that I managed to turn it around and get the win.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No, I don't feel pressure, I just came as a huge underdog, so no, I'm not feeling any pressure obviously. Even the next round is quite tough I think, whoever wins. So, to be honest, I don't care what people expect me to do well or to lose or win, I don't care about that anymore so much.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't feel any pressure at all. I'm just here to play tennis and have fun. I'm not thinking about rankings or anything like that. I'm just focused on the game and enjoying the challenge.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I'm still looking at it as an opportunity, you know, to just go out there and do the best I can. I have nothing to lose at this point, so I just have to keep focused on my matches and try to win every match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's natural to feel more pressure when you've had some victories and other top players have fallen out of the draw. However, it also fuels my motivation to work harder and prove that I can continue to perform well. I'm ready to face the challenges ahead and give it my all.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I wouldn’t say I feel more pressure, but I’m aware that expectations might be higher now. I know that every match is challenging, and I’ll just stay focused on my game and take it one match at a time.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>No, actually I'm not thinking about this when I'm on court. I'm on court to playing my tennis, and my tennis is... Yeah, like it is to moving goods, playing a lot of balls back and fighting. And it's not changing because I'm the number one now, or the top seeder. I mean, on court I'm really focusing on playing my game and running for every ball, so I was actually not panicking at all.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I was just focused on the match. I had an opponent that was very tough to play and I knew I needed to fight for every ball. And I just didn't think about the score or anything like that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> *"I think there were definitely moments where I felt the pressure, but I tried to stay focused on the game. It’s never easy, and I’ve been in tough situations before. I just had to keep pushing through, stay in the moment and not let those thoughts affect my performance."*

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, there were moments in the third set where I felt the pressure and thought about the possibility of losing. It was a challenging match, and the tension was high. However, I tried to stay focused and in-the-moment to give my best performance.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Definitely don't think anybody would have put their money on me to get this far in the tournament. So that would probably be in there. I certainly have been a big underdog and I think I've held that title really well and fought my hardest. And I think that can be in there. And yeah, I think people can make it whatever they want to make it. And there's a lot of positives to take away from this. And yeah, it's been an incredible run. Unfortunately, I wish the narrative could have been different for me today, but a lot to be proud of and I think a lot to build off of.</div>
