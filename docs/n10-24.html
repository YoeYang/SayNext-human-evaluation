So I may have been at the other young guys are doing well now as well. And there's all of their first quarters as well. And nothing but the best for them. This is one of many tournaments. So you can't really compete every single week saying, oh, you made semis there, a quarter's there, and I got to beat that. No, actually, I want to be the best. But yeah, not this week.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, definitely. We are all very competitive and always looking to improve. When we see our peers doing well, it motivates us to push harder and achieve better results. It's a healthy rivalry that helps us all grow.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, for sure, I mean, especially if you're young, you want to beat the other guys. You want, like, he's next to you, so you have to do it, and that's, that was the first time for me that I played in the quarterfinals of a grand slam, the second time. So I was really, really excited. I knew that he was playing really well, too, but I really wanted to go out there and, yeah, it was fun. It was a fun match, man.

It pushes us to do better, but it's not just about beating the others. It's about pushing yourself to the limit and improving every time you step on the court. The competition is tough, but we also motivate each other to reach new levels.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I think it's kind of both. I do feel a little bit, but it's nothing really to worry. I just were like more mental, you know, because I was very nervous too and then you know the match was pretty equal, so it was just more like precocious. I think it's yeah.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> No, I don't feel the leg at all when I play. It's more mental for me. I focus on my technique and my game strategy rather than feeling any pain.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it’s a mix of both. There is some physical discomfort, especially during certain movements, but I would say a lot of it is also mental. I try to not let it get to me while I’m playing, but it’s definitely something I’m aware of throughout the match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was fine. I didn't think about it too much. It was more of a mental thing because I know that if I put too many pressure on my legs, then it's going to be done. So I just thought that I have to play my game, I think I did it well. And I'm not really feeling pain, so I don't know why I've been talking about the leg.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, I think she had her first serve really well. I don't usually see her go for a first serve that often. And she had the second serve really well. And I think I just could have played break points a little better. And I was definitely very competitive on every game, but just a few too many errors. So it was still a really good match.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was trying to stay focused and maintain my composure. I knew she was playing well, so I didn't want to give her any extra attention or let her get under my skin. I just tried to stay in the moment and play each point as it came.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know if there's anything I can do because I tried everything. I just tried to keep the pace up, keep changing direction and I think I did that pretty well. She definitely had a pretty good game plan and she executed it really well today.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I tried to mix up my shots and play a bit more aggressively to disrupt her rhythm. I also focused on moving her around the court to make it harder for her to maintain her consistency. However, she played an amazing game and it was challenging to find openings.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, honestly, I was focused on playing my game and staying consistent. She was in great form, and sometimes you just have to tip your hat to someone who's performing at that level. There’s not much you can do except keep fighting and try to capitalize on any opportunities you get.

So I feel like there's a good atmosphere going on, which keeps me entertained and focused on the court and then try to stay positive, which worked out. How long did it stay committed to?</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's all about focus and preparation. I've been working hard for a long time to get to this point, so when it comes down to it, I just stay in the moment and trust my training.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I'm getting better at that. I mean, I did feel nerves out there a couple of times, but I was able to calm myself down. And I just tried to have fun out on the court and enjoy the moment.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for that question. Staying calm in high-pressure situations is a crucial part of my preparation and mindset. I focus on the process, visualizing the game plan, and maintaining a positive attitude. This helps me stay grounded and composed, even when the stakes are high. It's a combination of mental toughness and experience that allows me to perform at my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Honestly, I just tried to stay focused on each point rather than the bigger picture. I told myself to trust my preparation and believe in my game. I felt that if I started overthinking, the nerves would take over, so I kept it simple and stayed in the moment.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the facial expression and body language of the athlete in the image, it appears that they may be feeling a bit overwhelmed or emotional. The hand covering their face suggests that they might be processing something internally, possibly related to the pressure or personal thoughts after the game. The lack of a confident or calm demeanor further hints that they may be reflecting on the question, or the outcome of their performance.

He will likely say something along the lines of:

**"Yeah, it definitely felt better today compared to the first two rounds. I think I played well overall, but there are still areas I need to improve on. Every match is a learning experience, and I'm just focused on keeping my head in the game for the next round."**

His tone may be somewhat reflective or humble, acknowledging the win but emphasizing the need for improvement.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think so far I played some good tennis. I'm happy with the way I've been playing. Obviously I have to be more consistent. Sometimes I play good points, sometimes I don't. But overall I am happy to play like this. And I will try to keep improving.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I felt quite good. It was a more comfortable win compared to the first two rounds, and I'm confident with my game right now. Three games in, I've been able to adjust and find my rhythm. I feel like I am in a good position and looking forward to continuing this momentum.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not really bothered with the racket string. I think it's fine. Yeah, I mean, it just depends on how I play. If I hit a lot of slices, then obviously the strings are gonna be a little bit tighter and it won't really allow me to move around as much as I want to. But it doesn't bother me too much.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the provided images and observing the athlete's body language and facial expression, the athlete appears to be tired or disinterested, possibly signaling frustration or weariness. He is resting his chin on his hand and seems to be looking off to the side, which may suggest a lack of engagement or discomfort with the question.

He will likely respond with:  
**"Honestly, it’s not something I really focus on during the match. Sometimes it can be an issue, but I don’t let it affect my game too much."**

This response would match the nonchalant or dismissive tone that might accompany his current demeanor.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, sometimes I do experience issues with racket tension during matches. It can be challenging to maintain the same level of consistency when dealing with such technical difficulties.
