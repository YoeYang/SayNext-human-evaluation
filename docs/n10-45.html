        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, you sort of tried to take things as they come. You know that he's going to make a push. He's going to try to do things a little bit differently in that third set. And I think I handle it well. There weren't really any opportunities either way until that 4-5 game. And then I had one legitimate opportunity. Maybe I would have liked to have done things differently if things didn't work out. But overall, I'm happy with how I dealt with numerous situations throughout the match and how I played. I think I did some things extremely well.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely tough. After those first two sets, I tried to stay focused because I knew he would push back. You have to expect a player of his caliber to not go down easily, so the challenge was to stay mentally strong and keep fighting.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it's hard. I was expecting him to start playing much better, but he didn't. And I didn' start well, too. But still, I mean, the match was not easy, especially the second set. It was almost a must-win for him. So it was a close one.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know in the third set it's just kind of new major starting We hold the serves in the beginning of the of the third set And I think that that game when she hold the serve I think that she really She come calm down a bit and from the time I think she she played better again than the end of the second Side when she missed it a lot So I think that for her She she came back and played better again. Yeah I don't know she left she went on a toilet. I was before there as well. There is nothing really special but Yeah, I think she I don't know she may become down a bit Same question</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think she played really well in the third set. Honestly, I didn’t expect her to come back with that level of energy after the second set, but she stayed composed and aggressive. I lost a bit of my rhythm, and she took advantage of that. It’s something I’ll need to work on moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't think I would have been surprised if she won the match. I mean, I think that she's a great player. She's playing really well and I saw she beat the number two seed, Serena Williams in the last round. So I knew that it's not going to be an easy match, but I was feeling good. And I didn't want to think about the result, to win the second set. Of course, if I'm going home, it would be a big disappointment, and it wouldn't be really nice. But I wanted to stay there, stay focused, believing in my game. Because I know that I can beat her.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the key difference in that third set was my ability to maintain my focus and composure. In the past, I've struggled with letting the momentum shift, but this time I made a conscious effort to stay grounded and keep playing my game. I'm not surprised she was able to bounce back in such a manner; it's a testament to her resilience and skill. The final set showed the true spirit of the game, where both players gave it their all. It was a challenging match, both physically and mentally, so I commend her for the way she finished strong.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was just a matter of staying focused and not getting too emotional. I've been in similar situations before and I know how important it is to stay calm and composed. As for my opponent, she played really well in the final set, but I was able to come back and win. It's always surprising when someone is down and then comes back strong like that.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, I don't necessarily think I played the best I've ever played, but, um, I mean, for me, what I take away from this is that I never gave up, um, and that's something that I'm really proud of myself for. And, um, there are moments in the match where I thought, like, this is getting really close, um, that I just thought I wouldn't forgive myself if I had, like, a little dip or a moment of, um, accepting defeat.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Oh, that's such a nice compliment from Caroline. I really appreciate her words. I felt really good out there today, and I think I was able to execute my game plan well. Everything just seemed to click, and I stayed focused throughout the match.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I appreciate Caroline's kind words, but I think there are always areas for improvement, even in what might be considered the best game of my life. I felt that I executed my strategy well and stayed focused throughout the match. The key moments that went well were when I maintained my composure under pressure and made smart decisions on court. However, there's always room to grow, both individually and as a team, so I'll continue to work on refining my skills and techniques.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, in our sport, you need a lot of help. You need the help of a coach, of the fitness team, a trainer, and a doctor. And all these people, they need to be in the team. So, yeah, that's one of our rules in tennis. I like to have the coaches, the people that I'm working with. They're part of my team and they can be with me at tournaments. It's not the same in other sports. Yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a great opportunity for the players to have that level of control and autonomy in their careers. Having a coach can be incredibly beneficial, not just in terms of improving their skills but also in managing their overall well-being and mental state. It's important for us to empower athletes to make decisions that align with their personal goals and aspirations. That being said, we also recognize the need for a structured approach to ensure that everyone involved is working together towards a common goal.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's an interesting aspect of tennis, to have the ability to hire coaches and manage your own career. It definitely gives us a sense of control, but with that comes responsibility. You need to make sure you surround yourself with the right people, because your team plays a big role in your success. It's not just about having the power, but knowing how to use it wisely.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I mean, actually, he was really good. I came back from this score because I wasn't feeling my rhythm today on the court. From the beginning, my serve wasn't working. I was doing too many mistakes, and I was just not really feeling good playing wise on the court, but somehow through the fighting and through everything, I think she even had advantage to go for five loss. So I could turn this match around, and I really, really realized it in the third set. So yeah, you sometimes lose a match like this, and you just really want to go back now, 45 minutes, and I will do things maybe differently, and I would really want to change it, but you cannot do it anymore.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I did, I mean, a lot of things went through my head and I was really frustrated and, you know, it was just the beginning of the match. I just wanted to go out there and really play some aggressive tennis and not really think too much and just go after it, but it's just, yeah, of course it did.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I believe that the stress of coming back from losing four games in the second circuit could have a significant impact on my performance. It's definitely something I need to work on and manage better in future matches. However, I am confident that I can bounce back and perform at my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, maybe the stress played a bit of a role. It’s tough to come back in such situations, and sometimes it’s not easy to stay focused. But I tried my best out there.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's definitely a challenge, but I've been through tough situations before and come out stronger. I'm focused on the present moment and giving my best in each point. The past matches are over, and I'm ready to approach this one with a clear mind and a positive attitude.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>A special moment, walking out on the court, and a special moment after match point or just before match point, when you get to match point and when you win the match point. I think those three components make it special when you're coming back. Obviously last year it also felt special in a way in Monaco when I came back after my first surgery ever. So yeah, you definitely see things a bit different when you've been gone for a long time or when you've come back from injury like I have in the last year or so. I've experienced it twice now. So yeah, it was great to be out there. I really enjoy myself, even though it wasn't so simple.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It feels like a process, you know? Coming back from a break or time away always brings a range of emotions—frustration, excitement, but also a sense of gratitude for the opportunity to play again. I'm just taking it one step at a time.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> During this period, there was a sense of uncertainty and anxiety, but I focused on staying positive and maintaining a routine. It was challenging, and I had to adapt to new circumstances. I'm glad to be back and ready to perform at my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I mean, I was sick, and I had to stay home for a few weeks. And then I came back, but I just felt like I needed to go home. I couldn't think of coming back to the tour for my first round. So I took the decision to say, hey, let's just take a bit more time. It's been a while since I've had the time off. But it was tough because I felt that I lost a lot of ranking points. That's what I'm worried about. You know, the ranking is not the most important thing, it's the health. When you are healthy, you can always come back and do the things.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I am. I'm feeling really, really good physically. Even though I had a few matches that went more than three hours, but overall feeling really good. I think I played great tournaments so far with my level of tennis. I think I improved it comparing to the end of the last year. I'm playing much, much more aggressive. I'm feeling that I am, from most of the shots, hitting them really, really good from the return, moving, forehand back and serving. I think everything is in good solid spots. So, feeling really excited by the final two.</div>

It’s definitely been a challenging week with the physical issues, but I’ve been working closely with my team and been taking it step by step.

When you had that issue, was it more emotional or more physical? I mean, yeah, a little bit of both. But I feel like it was more, let's say, physical.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, it was really important. I mean, there was a great group of guys playing there and a very high level. So to be able to finish off how I did, I was very close to finishing with a win, but still extremely proud of my efforts. And one of the main things I wanted to do in 2018 was to back up my level week after week. And I thought I did that tremendously well and to be able to come back in the last tournament of the year where you're not feeling your best, you're tired, body's a bit fatigued, and to come out and play some good tennis and just come short in the final. I was very happy with myself and obviously gave me a lot of confidence coming into 2019.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Last year in Milan was a truly remarkable experience for me. Playing in the next gen tournament was incredibly different from anything I've done before. The level of competition and the intensity of the matches were both new and challenging. It was an opportunity to learn and grow, to adapt to different playing styles, and to develop new strategies. Overall, it was invaluable in my career and I gained a lot from that experience.

"Yeah, it was definitely a unique experience. The format was different, and there were some adjustments I had to make, but overall, it gave me a great opportunity to learn and improve in a way that I hadn't anticipated. It’s always valuable to step outside your comfort zone and try new things, even if the setup is different from what you’re used to."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It was a great experience, definitely. Playing in the Next Gen was a new challenge for me, and it was a lot of fun. I learned a lot from that experience, and it helped me grow as a player. It was a different format, but it was still an exciting opportunity to compete against some of the best players in the world.

I've played a lot of juniors last year and this was a great opportunity for me to play a couple of matches against some really good players and just really get a feel for how I can compete against these guys and also get used to the atmosphere of a packed arena. It was nice.
