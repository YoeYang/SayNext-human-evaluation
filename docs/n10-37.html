              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, there were a few things that caught my attention today. I was particularly impressed by her ability to maintain focus and composure under pressure. She handled herself with such grace and determination, which was really surprising given the level of competition. Overall, it was a truly inspiring performance.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think she's playing really well. I didn't see her play before I came here, so I don't know if she played like this before, but I know she is very aggressive. She hits the ball really hard, and she was very smart on court, she didn' let me get a lot of balls. So I was trying to mix a little bit, to go to the net, like I said, because she can finish the point really quick, you know, with her forehand. But I just tried to stay aggressive, try to get her to move.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Not really, to be honest. I knew she was going to play at a high level—she always does—so I came in prepared for that. There were some points where she raised her game, but overall, nothing really caught me off guard. I just tried to focus on my game plan and adjust when I needed to.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm glad you asked. While I've had some experience in this area, today's performance was truly remarkable. The way she handled the pressure and executed her shots with such precision was unexpected. It was a display of both skill and mental fortitude that I hadn't anticipated. Her ability to stay focused under intense scrutiny is something that genuinely surprised me.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>You know in the third set it's just kind of new major starting We hold the serves in the beginning of the of the third set And I think that that game when she hold the serve I think that she really She come calm down a bit and from the time I think she she played better again than the end of the second Side when she missed it a lot So I think that for her She she came back and played better again. Yeah I don't know she left she went on a toilet. I was before there as well. There is nothing really special but Yeah, I think she I don't know she may become down a bit Same question</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was just a matter of staying focused and not getting too emotional. I've been in similar situations before and I know how important it is to stay calm and composed. As for my opponent, she played really well in the final set, but I was able to come back and win. It's always surprising when someone is down and then comes back strong like that.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I think she played really well in the third set. Honestly, I didn’t expect her to come back with that level of energy after the second set, but she stayed composed and aggressive. I lost a bit of my rhythm, and she took advantage of that. It’s something I’ll need to work on moving forward.

              <!-- 按你的描述，用户从 Answer 1/2/3 中选择；这里显式标注原始编号 -->
              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think the key difference in that third set was my ability to maintain my focus and composure. In the past, I've struggled with letting the momentum shift, but this time I made a conscious effort to stay grounded and keep playing my game. I'm not surprised she was able to bounce back in such a manner; it's a testament to her resilience and skill. The final set showed the true spirit of the game, where both players gave it their all. It was a challenging match, both physically and mentally, so I commend her for the way she finished strong.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't think I would have been surprised if she won the match. I mean, I think that she's a great player. She's playing really well and I saw she beat the number two seed, Serena Williams in the last round. So I knew that it's not going to be an easy match, but I was feeling good. And I didn't want to think about the result, to win the second set. Of course, if I'm going home, it would be a big disappointment, and it wouldn't be really nice. But I wanted to stay there, stay focused, believing in my game. Because I know that I can beat her.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean for me, I've been actually practicing drop shots a lot recently. Just for fun. And yeah, I decided to play a few in the match because I think when I get in the position to either hit a winner, I think people start backing up anyways. So I think that that in a way could also be considered a good shot to hit.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> "I don't know if it was specifically the strategy. I was just trying to stay focused and adapt to the situation, but it's definitely something that worked in that moment." 

Based on the athlete's expression, there is a sense of contemplation or thoughtfulness. The neutral facial expression and focused body posture suggest they may be reflecting on the moment rather than giving an immediate, decisive answer. The answer likely indicates a thoughtful and measured response.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I didn't really have a strategy, to be honest. I just went out there and I played the same way I do in practice. And yeah, I mean, she's got a lot of power and she hits the ball very clean. So I think she has a really good serve and a good forehand.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The drop shot was indeed a key part of our strategy, especially during the last match. We practiced it extensively leading up to the tournament, and it paid off when we needed it most.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I'm quite consistent. I can play consistent all year. Like last year, I won in Brisbane. I played quite a final here. Then, you know, I won in Dubai, in Rome. So I can play well throughout the year. And it's just a matter of being fresh and being mentally prepared. And of course, physically, it's a big part of my game. So I will try to do that. Any last questions in English? Do you go back to Europe now?</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I tend to perform better as the season progresses. I find my rhythm with each match and gain more confidence throughout the year. It's a learning process, and I try to build on it week by week.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, I definitely feel that I improve as the season progresses. The end of the year brings a lot of growth and experience, which helps me refine my skills and techniques. It's a great way to end the experience.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I'm getting better, but it's not easy to say. I don't want to think about it. The only thing is to go there and play. Because if I would think, then I can say, OK, I was better today than last year. OK. And then it can go the other way, too. But I know that I have to work a lot to get better. So I will do it and try to be better every day.

Then with double break, then I found out that I'm free-love down in 15-40 on my serve in the third set. So it's been a bit insane, but it's a tennis match. Every thing can happen. I was just in the third set. I felt like Elena was in total control of the game, but you know, it's never done until you shake the hand. So I was trying to fight and staying there. I was not playing my best, but I fight hard and in the end I won. So I'm pretty happy with that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Winning the world rankings is a significant milestone for me. It represents the culmination of hard work and dedication over the years. However, winning the four major tournaments holds a different kind of importance. Winning a major tournament is about not just the rankings but also the experience, the memories, and being part of the history of tennis. Each tournament has its unique challenges and excitement. So, while both are important, they represent different aspects of my journey and aspirations in tennis.

It's not just about the ranking, but also about the hard work and dedication it takes to get there.

And also, winning a Grand Slam is the biggest goal for me, but the ranking definitely helps me a ton. It helps my ranking and also helps with my confidence. So I'm really excited about it.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yes, practicing the reverse cross of the forehand is crucial in tennis. It's a challenging stroke that requires precision and timing. I've put in a lot of effort to master this technique, and it's definitely one of my strengths on the court.

"Well, I don't know her that well, but I respect all my opponents. Age doesn't really factor into it for me—it's about how you play on the day. I’ve faced all kinds of players, and it’s about making sure I’m ready for whatever challenge comes my way. It’s always tough, but that's what makes this sport exciting."

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a prediction of the athlete's next response based on facial expressions and body language as the video content does not include any visual cues that would allow me to analyze her expressions or body language. Additionally, the video does not contain audio, so I cannot listen to the reporter's question or the athlete's response.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I've seen some of her matches and she's a very talented player. She has a lot of potential, and it's always interesting to see what new players bring to the court. When I think about facing someone who is younger, I try to focus on my own game and not get distracted by their age. I remember when I was younger and facing more experienced players, so I know what it feels like. It's important to stay grounded and just play my best tennis.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I mean, she's a player that I've seen a lot of times. I actually watched her play the US Open a couple years ago. So I know she plays a very good game of tennis. And I'm just going to go out there and I just got to focus on myself and do what I have to do to win.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, but he has to agree too. I mean, even if I want someone, it's got to be pretty mutual. I haven't thought of it that way, to be honest, though. Now, it doesn't hurt to reach out simple as that or to seek help in any way that you could possibly think you need. I mean, that's all. I mean, the decision was made purely because we all, the team, we really wanted to improve, which we wanted to add something to maximize our potential on every corner. And yeah, I think reaching out was the right thing. And things are, as I said, things are going in the right path right now. So hopefully, things stays like that.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's a great opportunity for the players to have that level of control and autonomy in their careers. Having a coach can be incredibly beneficial, not just in terms of improving their skills but also in managing their overall well-being and mental state. It's important for us to empower athletes to make decisions that align with their personal goals and aspirations. That being said, we also recognize the need for a structured approach to ensure that everyone involved is working together towards a common goal.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I mean, in our sport, you need a lot of help. You need the help of a coach, of the fitness team, a trainer, and a doctor. And all these people, they need to be in the team. So, yeah, that's one of our rules in tennis. I like to have the coaches, the people that I'm working with. They're part of my team and they can be with me at tournaments. It's not the same in other sports. Yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's an interesting aspect of tennis, to have the ability to hire coaches and manage your own career. It definitely gives us a sense of control, but with that comes responsibility. You need to make sure you surround yourself with the right people, because your team plays a big role in your success. It's not just about having the power, but knowing how to use it wisely.
