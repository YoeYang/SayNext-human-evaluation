        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I feel really good buddy-wise, and I feel good mentally, which is huge for me. And yeah, the results have come after that, which is nice. And played really well at the end of last year. Probably sound the best tennis I've ever played. So that was great. And I'm just trying to find my footing this year and feel like I've been playing some good tennis. I'm feeling confident and good about this year.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It appears you're asking for an analysis of the athlete's possible response based on their body language and facial expressions. However, I currently cannot access or view video files directly. Based on the image you provided, though, I can still offer some observations.

In the photo, the athlete appears to be listening attentively, with a slight upward gaze and focused expression. This could suggest she is processing the question thoughtfully, and perhaps feels a bit introspective or pleased with the progress described. The slight smile or neutral expression might indicate a sense of satisfaction or acknowledgment.

Given the positive tone of the reporter’s question, her response might reflect gratitude or a positive outlook. She may acknowledge the steady improvement with some humility or appreciation for the opportunity to reflect on her progress.

She will likely say something along the lines of: 
"I’m definitely feeling positive about how things are going. It’s been a steady climb, and I’m really happy with the progress I’ve made since the latter half of last year. I just want to keep working hard and improving." 

Would you like to analyze any other aspects or provide more context for further insights?

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Based on the facial expressions and body language observed in the image, the athlete appears thoughtful, possibly reflecting on the game or considering the reporter's question. His posture is slightly upright, with a focus on the reporter, and his expression shows a mix of concentration and mild contemplation.

He will likely respond with something along the lines of:

**"I was a bit surprised, yes. It’s always interesting when an opponent changes their game plan mid-match. I had to adjust quickly, but I think I was able to find a way to break through when he shifted back to serve and volley. It’s part of the game, really."**

This response aligns with the body language of someone processing the question carefully and offering a reflective yet confident answer.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not surprised at all. I knew he was going to change his strategy, and I was prepared for it. I had a plan in place and was able to adapt quickly. It's always important to be flexible and adjust your game as needed.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was not surprised by his change in strategy. I anticipated that he might revert to his baseline play after the phase passage in the second set. However, I believe that my ability to read the game and adapt to different situations allowed me to continue breaking his service and maintaining control.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was a little bit surprised, but he was playing very well. I think he served very, very smart. He knew when to go for it. And he knew, he knows how to serve well, and he can serve quite big. So I didn't feel that I could run it down, even if I wanted to, which I did, I tried to run a lot. But he just served so smartly that he got a couple of breaks in the second set.

        <legend>Question 3（ID 16）</legend>

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, I mean, it's always impossible to say. Without a doubt, playing a lot of matches and being matched tough, having a lot of confidence in that process is very valuable. I haven't had that right now. So I'm sure that factors in somewhere along the line. I thought today, even though I haven't played, I mean, he was a really tough opponent. But I mean, for me, it's, yeah, obviously, a tough grass season. But definitely some positives, being back onto the match court, being able to play two tournaments, getting in a few more matches. So hopefully, I'll be able to keep progressing and find more momentum heading into the hard court swing in the states.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. Yes, I believe the mouthguard did play a significant role in helping me get back into the game after my injury. It provided me with the necessary protection and confidence to perform at a high level.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm glad to be back on the court and competing at Wimbledon. It's always a special tournament for me. I've been focusing on my recovery and getting back into the rhythm of things. I'm not really sure what you mean by "mouth play," but I'm here to compete and give it my all. I'm excited to see how the rest of the tournament goes.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm not sure. I don't think it's physical. It's more mental, more, you know, I had a little bit of doubt going into the tournament, which is something I didn't have before. And that's something that I was able to, to work through. But I still felt like I wasn't 100% confident, but I just tried to go out there and play as I would normally.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, it's tough to say for sure. I think coming back from the injury, there are lots of factors to consider. Mouth play might have been one of them, but I’m still trying to find my rhythm and get back to full fitness. Overall, I’m focused on improving with each tournament.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, well, the third set was definitely a challenging one. During that time, I find myself having internal conversations to keep pushing through. I remind myself of my training, my goals, and the hard work that has brought me to this point. It's about maintaining focus and not letting the fatigue overpower me. Those internal dialogues are crucial in helping me dig deep and find the strength to continue.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I don't think it matters much. Each match is different, and what happened in the past doesn’t guarantee anything in the future. Roger is a great player, and I know I will have to play at my best to have a chance to win on Sunday.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's always good to have a strong record against an opponent, but it's not the only factor that determines success in a match. I'll focus on my own game and do my best.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know. I just know that I have been playing well during the past weeks. That's the most important thing. And I hope to keep doing that. Well, I'm happy to be back playing again. It's a great start for me. So I cannot complain.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It definitely does have value. Having a better record against Roger is a significant advantage. When you step onto the court on Sunday, you know you have the edge based on our previous encounters. It boosts your confidence and provides a psychological advantage, which can be crucial in high-stakes matches like this one.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Well, he was playing well, but nevertheless, the first two sets, it was me back before six months, and for the third set I finally showed up on the court, so that's good. And that's the only one of the positives that I can take from the match, and that's it. I mean, of course he started well, but if you allow him to start well, then that's not a problem. Actually, on the level like Rafa is to play a good tennis, so that was absolutely understandable for the circumstances that was going on, but yeah, I mean, for me at least the experience that I can take from the match is that I was able to find the way and find the way I was playing here, at least for the third set. A bit unlucky at the end of the third set, but that's all right.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was definitely something different for me. I didn't expect to play that well. He's a big hitter, so I was looking forward to the challenge, but I mean, he's been playing great tennis for the last couple of months. And yeah, I just wanted to go out there and play my game. It was my first Grand Slam, quarterfinal, and I think I played solid, simple tennis. How did you feel that you had a chance to win? I don't know. In my mind, the match was 2-0 up. So I had to break his serve at 30-15 in the first set and 40-30 in sets 3, 4, you know, to have a good chance. But I knew I needed to do a lot of things well and then wait for my chance, wait until the break.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, it was a bit unexpected. Rapper played incredibly well today. I was trying to adapt to his game, but he was just on fire, hitting all the right shots. It was a tough match, but that's tennis – sometimes things just don't go your way. I’ll learn from this and keep moving forward.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Rapper was playing really well today. He was very aggressive from the start and kept the pressure on throughout the match. It was impressive to see him play with such confidence and intensity. I think he's been a key player for our team this tournament.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I, my serve was really off. I felt like I wasn't moving well. I felt like my backhand wasn't kind of going through the court like he usually does. And I felt like I was making a lot of forehand mistakes.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I served well. I played well in the first set, but then I started to play more aggressive. And then, you know, I was able to get back in control in time, and then he just went away, so I didn't really have any answers.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> It seems that the files you've uploaded contain images, but I cannot directly analyze video or make predictions about an athlete's next spoken response based solely on images. If you'd like, I can still offer an interpretation of the athlete's body language from the images you've shared. Would you like me to do that?
