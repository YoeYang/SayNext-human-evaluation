        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Yeah, we need him to play first before commentating for the next whatever, 10 plus years. But now he's always good for a headline. And look, I like Nick. I like the way he plays and all that. So yeah, I was happy to hear that he was in the commentary booth. You know, he's got a bit of time, sticks around, shows that he's passionate about the game and all that. That's what we need to see. But of course, we wish he was on the court rather than a commentary booth. But I hope he did a good job.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm surprised he moved this well. I thought he was going to have a hard time with the lighting and the conditions and all of that. But I guess he just loves it. And I feel like he loves to play big stadiums at night. So he can really take advantage of his serve and his forehand and he's got an amazing serve. He's amazing.

I just try to go day by day. I needed hours of court, hours of practice, hours of playing sets with different players and that's what I did. I think I did a good preparation here. I felt myself playing well and that's all. Here I am, I am in the four round and that's because I am doing the right things and let's see how far I can go.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the question. I'm glad to hear that I've been playing well thus far. However, it's important to remember that tennis is a dynamic sport, and my performance can change from match to match. While I did feel confident coming into the tournament, I also knew that there was a lot of work to be done to maintain that level of play. It's always a learning process, so I'll continue to focus on improving my skills and adapting to different opponents.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> But yeah, I mean, it's tough to say that I'm disappointed. I think I was playing really well. And honestly, when I came here, the goal was just to enjoy it. But of course, losing like this, you know, hurts. So, yeah.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I understand your perspective, but as an athlete, I always strive to give my best effort and learn from every experience, whether it's a win or a loss. While it’s natural to feel disappointed after a match, especially if it didn't go as expected, it is important to maintain a positive outlook and focus on what I can improve upon. I am determined to keep pushing forward and continue growing as a player. Thank you for your question.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> ** "It’s definitely tough... I expected more from myself, and it’s hard to come to terms with. But I know I need to keep moving forward, work on what went wrong, and learn from it. It’s a hard loss, but it's part of the sport." 

Her response likely reflects a balance between disappointment and a mindset to learn and grow from the defeat.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I felt like I've been hit by the train in the first set and everything was too fast. So I didn't get scared about the first set because I knew I have a better level and I can play better if I stay there and I really start moving better and hitting the ball stronger. After the first set I got that fire inside myself and I said that now I start the match so it was much better. And game by game I felt that my level is growing and I had more confidence to go through it.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, first of all, I think humor is a great icebreaker, so feel free to start with that joke! [laughs] Honestly, though, in the first set, I think I was overthinking and maybe putting a little too much pressure on myself. But during the break, I took a moment to reset, focused on my strategy, and reminded myself to enjoy the game regardless of the outcome. The crowd's energy really pushed me to give it my all in the second set!

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you so much for the question. It's great to hear that you enjoyed the game. The first set did go really fast, but I tried to stay focused and composed. For the second set, I knew I had to be more patient and strategic. I also tried my best to enjoy the moment and stay in the present.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for the compliment. It was a great game, and I'm glad I could deliver in the second set. To be honest, I was a bit nervous at first, but I tried to stay focused and keep my mind on the game. I also had a lot of support from my team and fans, which helped me stay motivated. As for the joke, I don't think I have one ready right now, but I'll try to come up with something good.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I appreciate your question. After reflecting on the incident, I realize that I did look at my notes before the event, but for some reason, the details were not fresh in my mind when the interview took place. Since then, however, a few more details have come to me. I have indeed been living in Bucke-Rittone. Thank you for your attention and for bringing this to light.
