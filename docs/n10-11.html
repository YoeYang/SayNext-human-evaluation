              <strong>Answer：</strong> It's always tough to rank games, but I think it was one of our best matches this year. We played really well together and came out on top.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Yeah, I think that third set was definitely up there. The first five games were intense, and we executed well, sticking to our strategy. It’s tough to compare, but it’s one of our best performances for sure.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The first five games of that third set were incredibly intense and showcased the grit and determination of the team. It definitely ranks among the best sets we've played this season, demonstrating our ability to stay focused and competitive under pressure.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was one of the best tennis I've ever played. I mean, she was just so unstoppable today. She made so many unbelievable shots. And I was like, wow, I'm just gonna have to dig deep and see what I can do. But she literally hit every ball in and made me work for every point. So it's not easy to talk about.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>I don't know, I think, well part of it I think is I really don't have anything to lose at the moment. I've probably gone into every single match is not the favourite and kind of underdog and I've obviously seen a lot of these girls play before and maybe they haven't seen me play too much and yeah I've definitely gained some confidence coming through the back end of last year and yeah I think that probably has something to do with it.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I don't know. I think I play my game well, but not every player. Some players, you need to play better against me, so that's why. And, yeah, I just try to be consistent.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Thank you for asking. I think part of it comes down to my preparation and mindset. When I approach a match against higher-ranked players, I make sure to do a thorough analysis of their playing style and strategize accordingly. Additionally, my mental toughness and ability to stay focused during matches have been crucial. It's also important to note that my consistent training and dedication to improving my skills have played a significant role.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it's because I'm always prepared and focused when I step onto the court. I've learned a lot from my experiences, both good and bad, and I use those lessons to stay one step ahead of my opponents.

        <div class="gt"><strong>Ground Truth：</strong>Obviously very happy with my first couple matches and even tonight I don't think I did a hell of a lot wrong I think if Naomi plays like that she beats a lot of players and I wasn't able to get into too many of her service games I had had a sniff in a couple of games where I was a big at 15 30s and 30 all points But you know she served great and played the big points played the big points well tonight</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think it was more about the team's cohesion and the players' execution rather than just one style or approach. The aggressive hitters definitely contributed, but the overall strategy and teamwork were crucial factors as well.

You know, it's not like I've walked on court being nervous in my first time of my life, so you still go on there and play your game. And today I just really did well at that, put the occasion, I'm aware of the occasion, but just really tried to throw some of the tennis and just enjoy as much as possible and yeah, it was a great feeling out there.</div>

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I'm feeling good. I had some issues during the first set, but it's normal. It's a tough match, and I was close to losing the match. But in the end, the important thing is that I played a good match and got the win, which is the most important.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I'm doing the best I can, but it's definitely been challenging. After such a long time without competition, the body needs some time to adjust. I felt it during the match, and I still feel it now. It's a process, but I'll keep pushing.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think what's most important to me is finding a player who has a similar playing style and mindset. Someone who understands the game as much as I do, and someone who is willing to put in the hard work and dedication needed to succeed. It's not just about winning, but also about the journey and the growth that comes with it. I want to be able to push each other to be our best selves on and off the court.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> For me, it’s all about finding the right balance—someone who can push me to improve, but also a player with whom I can have a good, constructive practice session. It’s important to feel challenged, but also to have a positive, motivating vibe on the court. Consistency is key, but so is the ability to adapt and bring different aspects to the game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> The most important thing for me when choosing a player to practice with or play against is their consistency and their ability to perform well under pressure. While having a good vibe and being enjoyable to be around is also important, it's the player's skills and reliability that ultimately make them stand out to me.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I think I'm looking for variety, that's for sure. I like variety in tennis and that was my goal coming here, to play different players, different game styles. And yeah, I just try to mix it up, mix a little bit of power, a bit more consistency, try a different tactic, you know, just to be ready for anything.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Well, I was thinking that it's going to be a big challenge for me to stay with the same intensity and the good game that I played in the first set. And I had a tough one, the third, but I managed to find the right shots and find my way back to play well in every game. I just kept myself focused and I knew that if I'm going through this set, that the fourth is going going well.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> Going into the fourth set, I just focused on staying calm and not overthinking. The first set was quick, but I knew the next ones would be tougher. I had to adjust my strategy and be more patient, but I remained confident in my game.

              <strong>Answer：</strong> I was definitely feeling confident coming into the fourth set, given how well I played in the first set. However, I knew that the match wasn't over yet and I needed to maintain my focus and intensity. I tried to stay composed and continue playing my game, even though the pace of the game changed a bit in those sets. Overall, it was a challenging match, but I'm proud of how I handled it.
